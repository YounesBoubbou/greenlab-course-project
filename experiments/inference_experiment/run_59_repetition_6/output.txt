 Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that studies methods and software enabling machines to learn from their environment and take actions for achieving defined goals. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence is among the long-term goals, but many applications are not perceived as AI. AI has gone through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding (AI winter). Funding increased after 2012 with deep learning outperforming previous AI techniques and again in 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the early 2020s, hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI. However, its widespread use exposed several unintended consequences and risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits of the technology.
