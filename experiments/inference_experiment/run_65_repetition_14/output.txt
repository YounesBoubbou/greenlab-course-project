The technical paper outlines artificial intelligence (AI) as a domain focused on creating systems that perceive environments, learn from data, and make decisions towards achieving goals traditionally performed by humans—spanning various realms like web search engines to strategy games. As AI becomes ubiquitous in daily applications without explicit labels of being 'AI', the field has evolved through cycles of hope followed by disillusionment known as "AI winters". Since 2012, deep learning methods revolutionized progress with significant funding infusions leading to an “AI boom”. The adoption and integration in numerous industries have prompted discussions on its societal impacts—positive or negative. AI research encompasses multiple subfields such as reasoning, planning, learning, etc., that draw from interdisciplinary studies including psychology and neuroscience to approach general intelligence goals while tackling ethical considerations for future developments in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles.
