The adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is crucial for global strategies to combat climate change. Technological advancements and decreasing costs have led to their growth. However, intermittency poses a challenge that necessitates energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs are used by policymakers to accelerate the transition. To achieve carbon neutrality, a holistic approach is required, incorporating energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
