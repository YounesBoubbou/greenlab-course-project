 The provided technical paper discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI), a computer science field that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks usually requiring human intelligence. Applications of AI range from web search engines, recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and creative tools. AI research focuses on traditional goals like reasoning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics, with the ultimate goal being general intelligence. Techniques used include search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, neural networks, and methods based on statistics and economics. The field experienced cyclical growth since its inception in 1956 but saw significant advancements after 2012 due to deep learning and transformer architectures. However, the widespread use of AI in the 21st century has raised concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and long-term effects, leading to discussions on regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
