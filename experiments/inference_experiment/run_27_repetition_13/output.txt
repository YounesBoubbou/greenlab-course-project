 Climate change is primarily driven by the increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), fossil fuel combustion accounts for about 63% of global CO2 emissions, making it the largest source of these GHGs (IPCC, 2014). Let's explore the primary sources of other significant greenhouse gases and how they vary across different industries.

Methane (CH4) is the second most prevalent GHG, accounting for about 16% of total human-induced GHG emissions (IPCC, 2014). The primary sources of methane emissions include agriculture (37%), fossil fuel production and use (35%), and waste management (28%) (EPA, 2021). In agriculture, livestock production is a significant contributor to methane emissions due to the digestive process of ruminants. Rice cultivation and manure management also contribute to agricultural methane emissions.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most prevalent GHG, accounting for about 7% of total human-induced GHG emissions (IPCC, 2014). The primary sources of nitrous oxide emissions are agriculture (68%) and industrial processes (31%) (EPA, 2021). In agriculture, nitrous oxide is primarily produced by the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers and livestock manure management. Industrial processes such as the production and use of adipic acid, caprolactam, glycerol, and nitric and nitrate fertilizers contribute significantly to industrial nitrous oxide emissions.

In summary, while CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion are the largest contributor to GHG emissions, methane and nitrous oxide also play substantial roles. Agriculture is a significant contributor to methane and nitrous oxide emissions, while fossil fuel production and use are primary sources of methane emissions. Understanding these sources can help us identify strategies for reducing GHG emissions across different industries.
