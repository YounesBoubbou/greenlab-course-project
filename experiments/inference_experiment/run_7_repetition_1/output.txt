The Industrial Revolution's legacy of greenhouse gas emissions has led to increased global warming concerns, prompting international efforts to mitigate its effects. Notably, the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and Paris Agreement (2015) have aimed to reduce emissions through nationally determined contributions. As a response to climate change, significant economic and technological advancements have emerged:

1. **Renewable Energy**: Solar and wind power have become increasingly cost-effective, making them attractive alternatives to fossil fuels. Governments have incentivized renewable energy adoption with policies like feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and auctions.
2. **Energy Storage**: Advancements in battery technology have improved the efficiency and affordability of storing excess energy generated from renewables. This has enabled a more stable grid and reduced reliance on fossil fuels.
3. **Electrification of Transportation**: Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained popularity, with governments offering incentives like subsidies, tax breaks, and investment in charging infrastructure. EVs are expected to dominate the market by 2040.
4. **Smart Grids**: The integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage has led to the development of smart grids, which optimize energy distribution, consumption, and generation.
5. **Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU)**: Technologies have been developed to capture CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial processes, utilizing it in products like concrete, fuels, and chemicals.
6. **Green Finance**: The rise of green bonds, impact investing, and sustainable development goals has attracted significant investments to climate-related projects and initiatives.
7. **Circular Economy**: Closed-loop production and recycling have become more prominent, reducing waste and promoting resource efficiency. This shift has also encouraged the design of products with recyclability in mind.

These advancements have not only helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also created new economic opportunities, job markets, and industries. As the world continues to respond to climate change, it is essential to maintain this momentum and develop innovative solutions to address the complexity of this global challenge.
