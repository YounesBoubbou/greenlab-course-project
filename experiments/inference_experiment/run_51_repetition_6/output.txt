The primary sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are diverse and vary significantly across various industrial sectors. In the energy sector, which is a major contributor to GHG emissions, fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation accounts for a significant portion of CO2 releases. Transportation, another critical industry, contributes substantially through the burning of gasoline, diesel, and other fuels in vehicles. Agriculture is a key source of methane (primarily from enteric fermentation in livestock) and nitrous oxide (from synthetic fertilizers and manure management). Industrial processes also emit GHGs, with sectors like chemical production, cement manufacturing, and waste management contributing to emissions through various activities such as energy use, raw material processing, and decomposition.

In addition to these sectors, land-use changes, such as deforestation, contribute significantly to CO2 emissions by reducing the number of trees that can absorb atmospheric carbon. Residential and commercial buildings generate GHGs primarily from heating and cooling, which often rely on fossil fuels. Lastly, while not an industry in itself, waste management is a significant source of methane emissions due to the decomposition of organic matter in landfills.

The variability across industries highlights the need for targeted mitigation strategies that consider sector-specific sources and technologies. For instance, shifting towards renewable energy sources can reduce CO2 emissions from the energy sector, improving agricultural practices can lower methane and nitrous oxide emissions, and implementing better waste management techniques can minimize methane release.
