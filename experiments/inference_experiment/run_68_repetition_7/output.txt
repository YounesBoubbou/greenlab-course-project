6. Bosnia and Herzegovina - Sarajevo 
7. Bulgaria – Sofia   
8. Croatia – Zagreb  
9. Cyprus—Nicosia

20. Ireland – Dublin    
21. Italy - Rome  
22. Kosovo—Pristina

44. Switzerland (federal structure makes Bern serve primarily in this capacity; Zurich & Geneva are also important cities hosting various international organizations and financial centers)    
50-member European Union—Brussels serves as the de facto capital due to its role with EU institutions, including Council of Europe  
49. Vatican City (a sovereign state enclaved within Rome’s city limits; a significant cultural hub and center for religion)   
50-member Eurozone—Brussels serves as the de facto capital due to its role with European Central Bank, but not all members are part of this currency union.  

This list encompasses capitals from both sovereign states in Europe (with exceptions like Denmark and Faroe Islands), microstates such as Andorra; it also recognizes de facto political centers for the European Union that serve significant roles alongside individual countries' capital cities, particularly Brussels. Notably, some nations with multiple historic capitals or important regional hubs have been included to acknowledge their cultural and historical significance beyond sole administrative functions of a singular city like Vienna (Austria), Warsaw (Poland) etc., all while staying within the 300-word limit for an overview rather than detail.
