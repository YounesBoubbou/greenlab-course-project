The paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), defining it as a field within computer science that develops methods for machines to exhibit human-like intelligence. AI applications range from web search engines and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and generative tools, though these may not always be recognized as such. The goals of AI research include reasoning, learning, perception, natural language processing, among others. Techniques used span search optimization, neural networks, statistics, operations research, and more. AI's history includes multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, with recent breakthroughs in deep learning and the transformer architecture driving significant investment. However, as AI's use has grown, so have concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and long-term risks, leading to calls for regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
