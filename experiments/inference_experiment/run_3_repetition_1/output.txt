Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor. The primary sources of GHG emissions are:

1. Fossil fuel combustion: The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production and transportation is the largest source of CO2 emissions.
2. Land use changes: Deforestation and land-use changes, such as agriculture and urbanization, contribute to GHG emissions by releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere.
3. Industrial processes: The production of cement, steel, and other industrial processes also emit significant amounts of GHGs.
4. Agriculture: The use of synthetic fertilizers and methane production from livestock are significant sources of GHG emissions in the agriculture sector.
5. Waste management: Methane emissions from landfills and wastewater treatment plants also contribute to GHG levels.

The distribution of GHG emissions across different industries varies, but some notable examples include:

1. Energy production and transmission: The fossil fuel industry is the largest source of CO2 emissions, accounting for around 40% of total emissions.
2. Transportation: The transportation sector, including cars, trucks, airplanes, and ships, accounts for around 30% of GHG emissions.
3. Manufacturing: Industrial processes such as cement production and steel manufacturing also contribute significantly to GHG emissions.
4. Agriculture: The agriculture sector accounts for around 15% of GHG emissions, with livestock being a significant source of methane emissions.
5. Waste management: Landfills and wastewater treatment plants account for around 5% of GHG emissions.

Understanding the primary sources of GHG emissions is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate climate change. By identifying the sectors and industries responsible for the majority of emissions, policymakers can prioritize interventions and implement measures to reduce emissions across different economic activities.
