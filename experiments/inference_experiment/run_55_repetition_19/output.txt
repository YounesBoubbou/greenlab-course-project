 The Industrial Revolution ushered in an era of unprecedented technological advancements and global economic growth. However, it also brought about significant environmental challenges, particularly with regards to greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Since then, there have been numerous efforts to mitigate the impacts of this phenomenon on the planet. One such effort has been the adoption of cleaner energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. These technologies have not only reduced emissions but also created new opportunities for economic growth in emerging industries like renewable energy. Additionally, technological innovations in transportation, agriculture, and other sectors have played a crucial role in mitigating the environmental impact of human activities. For instance, the use of precision farming techniques has led to significant improvements in crop yields while reducing the need for fertilizer application. Similarly, advancements in electric vehicles and smart city infrastructure are helping to reduce emissions from transportation and energy consumption. Overall, economic and technological responses to climate change have not only helped to mitigate its impacts but also created new opportunities for sustainable development.
