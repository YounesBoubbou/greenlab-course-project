The adoption of renewables is pivotal for climate change mitigation due to solar and wind power's growth from tech advancements and cost reductions. However, their intermittency challenges energy systems, requiring investments in storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers have offered incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs to accelerate the shift towards renewables. Achieving carbon neutrality will necessitate a comprehensive approach that includes not only renewable energy transition but also energy efficiency improvements, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
