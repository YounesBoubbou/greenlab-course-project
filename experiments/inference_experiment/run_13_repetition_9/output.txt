The Industrial Revolution's legacy can be seen in the modern era's increased focus on sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The rise of renewable energy sources has been a significant development, with solar and wind power becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), solar energy has grown from 0.05% of global electricity generation in 2004 to over 3% in 2020.

Technological innovations have also played a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Electric vehicles, for instance, have become more mainstream, with many countries investing heavily in EV infrastructure. By 2025, it is estimated that over 50% of new car sales will be electric (IEA). Furthermore, the development of smart grids and energy storage systems has improved the efficiency of renewable energy integration into the power grid.

Economically, there have been significant shifts towards sustainable practices. The cost of clean technologies has decreased dramatically, making them more accessible to developing countries. According to a report by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), wind turbine costs have fallen by 70% over the past decade. Additionally, many companies are now incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into their investment decisions, recognizing the financial benefits of sustainability.

The Paris Agreement's commitment to limiting global warming to well below 2Â°C has spurred further innovation and investment in climate-resilient infrastructure and technologies. This includes advancements in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), as well as the development of green finance mechanisms. The World Bank estimates that by 2025, green bonds will reach $1 trillion in outstanding debt, marking a significant milestone in sustainable financing.
