Renewable energy sources have been crucial in combatting climate change. Solar and wind power have experienced significant growth due to technological advancements and decreased costs. However, their intermittency presents a challenge for energy systems, requiring the development of energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers use incentives such as tax credits and feed-in tariffs to accelerate the transition. Achieving carbon neutrality necessitates a holistic approach that incorporates energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
