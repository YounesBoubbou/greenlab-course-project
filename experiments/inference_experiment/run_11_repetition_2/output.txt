The technical paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science. AI enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. The paper highlights various AI applications, including search engines, recommendation systems, human-computer interaction, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools. AI subfields focus on specific goals and techniques, such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. The long-term goal is to achieve general intelligence, which enables machines to complete any task performed by a human. The paper also touches on the history of AI, including its founding in 1956 and subsequent "AI winters" due to funding losses. However, since 2012, AI has experienced significant growth with the development of deep learning and transformer architecture, leading to widespread adoption and concerns about unintended consequences, regulatory policies, and long-term effects.
