Climate change is primarily driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation within Earth's atmosphere due to human activities. Carbon dioxide emissions, stemming largely from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil in power plants for electricity generation—a significant source across various industries including energy production, manufacturing, transportation (vehicles), heating buildings, steel making, cement fabrication, refrigeration systems among others.

Methane is another potent GHG; its primary sources include leakage during oil and gas extraction processes in the fossil fuel industry, enteric fermentation from ruminants (cows) within agriculture sectors that are heavily reliant on livestock for meat production or dairy farming. It also arises naturally through anaerobic decomposition of organic material under wetland conditions and as a byproduct in the form of fugitive emissions during oil extraction, transportation, storage, processing phases from coal mining to refineries – industries that are notorious for their significant methane footprint.

Nitrous oxide is mostly released through agricultural practices which contribute 60% towards global N2O emission—mainly due to the application of synthetic and organic fertilizers, poor management techniques like overuse or inappropriate use timing on soils (animal husbandry), especially rice cultivation. Industrial production processes such as chemical manufacturing also contribute through energy-intensive operations involving high temperatures which favor N2O formation when using certain catalysts and solvents, although to a lesser extent compared with agriculture sector emissions.

In summary, while all these industries significantly impact GHG emission rates: Energy production (fossil fuels) is the biggest source contributing mainly carbon dioxide; livestock farming stands out for methane release and industrial activities are associated with minor releases of nitrous oxides. Transitioning towards cleaner renewable energy sources, sustainable agriculture practices including improved fertilizer application methods/timings could mitigate these emissions significantly reducing the risk posed by climate change induced temperatures rise affecting biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse among others.
