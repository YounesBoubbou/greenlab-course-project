 The provided technical paper discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI), a computer science field that develops methods enabling machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions for defined goals. Applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and game analysis. AI subfields focus on areas such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics support. The ultimate goal is general intelligence. Techniques used in AI research include search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. First emerging in 1956, AI has seen cycles of optimism and disappointment known as "AI winter," but funding and interest increased significantly after the development of deep learning techniques in 2012 and the transformer architecture in 2017, leading to the current "AI boom." With increasing use, unintended consequences and concerns about risks and long-term effects have emerged, prompting discussions on regulatory policies.
