 AI is a computer science field that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions. Applications range from web search engines to autonomous vehicles. Key subfields include reasoning, natural language processing, perception, and learning. The ultimate goal is general intelligence. Over the years, AI has experienced boom-and-bust cycles, with a resurgence since 2012 due to deep learning and transformer architectures. This growth has brought widespread use of AI but also unintended consequences and ethical concerns, leading to discussions about regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
