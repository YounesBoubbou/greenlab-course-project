## Primary Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Across Industries

**Carbon Dioxide:**

* **Power generation:** Burning coal, natural gas, and oil for electricity and heating.
* **Transportation:** Emissions from vehicles fueled by fossil fuels.
* **Industrial processes:** Production of cement, steel, and other materials.
* **Agriculture:** Emissions from livestock digestion and agricultural practices.
* **Residential and commercial buildings:** Energy use for heating, cooling, and lighting.


**Methane:**

* **Agriculture:** Enteric fermentation in livestock and manure management.
* **Waste management:** Decomposition of organic matter in landfills.
* **Natural wetlands:** Decomposition of vegetation in wetlands.
* **Offshore oil and gas production:** Leaks and methane releases from production and transportation.


**Nitrous Oxide:**

* **Agriculture:** Soil management practices and fertilizer use.
* **Wastewater treatment:** Emissions from the decomposition of organic matter.
* **Agriculture and livestock:** Nitrification processes in soil and manure.

**Variation Across Industries:**

* **Power generation:** Highest emissions per unit of energy produced.
* **Transportation:** Second-highest emissions per unit of travel distance.
* **Manufacturing:** Varies widely depending on the specific industry and production processes.
* **Agriculture:** Significant emissions from livestock and agricultural practices.
* **Construction:** High emissions from cement production and energy use.

**Factors influencing variation:**

* **Technology used:** Different industries utilize different energy sources with varying greenhouse gas intensities.
* **Production volume:** Larger production volumes lead to greater emissions.
* **Energy efficiency:** Industries can reduce emissions through energy efficiency measures.
* **Raw material extraction and processing:** Certain industries have emissions associated with their production processes.
