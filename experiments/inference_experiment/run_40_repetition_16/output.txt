The adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind is crucial for combating climate change. Technological advancements and decreasing costs have contributed to their remarkable growth. However, intermittent power poses challenges for energy systems, necessitating storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers' incentives, such as tax credits and feed-in tariffs, support the transition. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach involving efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and international collaboration.
