Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor due to fossil fuel combustion. Other potent greenhouse gases like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) also play substantial roles. The primary sources of these emissions vary across different industries.

Fossil fuel combustion is the largest source of CO2 emissions, accounting for approximately 65% of total emissions. This includes:

1. Energy generation and transmission: Power plants, industrial processes, and transportation systems emit significant amounts of CO2.
2. Industry: Cement production, steel manufacturing, and other industrial processes release large quantities of CO2.

Methane emissions primarily come from:

1. Agriculture: Livestock farming, rice cultivation, and natural gas and oil systems release CH4.
2. Natural Gas Systems: Venting and flaring of methane during extraction, processing, and transportation contribute to emissions.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions originate mainly from:

1. Industrial Processes: Cement production, adipic acid manufacturing, and other industrial processes release N2O.
2. Agriculture: Fertilizer use, livestock farming, and soil cultivation contribute to N2O emissions.

The varying sources of greenhouse gas emissions across industries highlight the need for targeted strategies to reduce emissions in each sector. For instance, improving energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and adopting clean technologies can help mitigate CO2 emissions from energy generation and transmission. In agriculture, practices like regenerative agriculture, manure management, and anaerobic digestion can reduce CH4 and N2O emissions.
