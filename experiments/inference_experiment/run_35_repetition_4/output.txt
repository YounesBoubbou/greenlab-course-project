 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions. It powers various applications such as web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and game analysis. Despite being integrated into general applications, its label is often absent due to widespread use. AI research focuses on traditional goals like reasoning, learning, natural language processing, and robotics, with the ultimate goal of general intelligence. Techniques used include search, optimization, logic, neural networks, and statistics. AI has faced multiple ups and downs since its inception in 1956 but gained significant momentum since 2012 due to deep learning advancements. As AI use increases, concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and long-term effects have arisen, prompting discussions on regulatory policies for safety and benefits.
