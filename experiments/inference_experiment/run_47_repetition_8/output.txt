Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as intelligence demonstrated by machines, particularly computer systems, that enables them to perceive their environment, learn from experiences, reason effectively, represent knowledge efficiently, plan strategically, optimize performance through learning and adaptation, process natural language fluently, make sense of visual data, interact via human speech, automate complex tasks like autonomous driving, generate creative content and play strategic games at superhuman levels. AI applications have permeated various domains including web search engines, recommendations systems in e-commerce platforms, virtual assistants, self-driving vehicles, generative models for art and text, among others.

AI research focuses on several areas such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing (NLP), perception, robotics, and the development of general intelligence capable of performing human-level tasks across different fields. Techniques used in AI include search algorithms, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, probabilistic methods, operations research, economics, among others.

AI's history is marked by several cycles of growth and setbacks known as "AI winters," influenced by funding availability and technological advancements. A significant breakthrough came with the advent of deep learning techniques around 2012 that outperformed previous AI methods. The transformative impact of AI architectures like transformers further fueled interest, leading to an investment boom in AI from the early 2020s onwards.

The widespread adoption of AI has resulted in unforeseen consequences and ethical dilemmas related to job displacement, privacy concerns, bias, and accountability issues. Discussions around regulatory frameworks for AI have intensified due to these considerations. In summary, while AI presents immense potential for societal benefit, it also poses significant challenges that require thoughtful consideration and management by policymakers and the tech industry.
