Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are key components of global strategies to combat climate change. Their growth is due to technological advancements and decreasing costs, but their intermittency poses a challenge. Energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies are necessary to overcome this challenge. Policymakers use incentives to accelerate the transition to renewable energy, but achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach that incorporates energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
