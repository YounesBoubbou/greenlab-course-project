The Industrial Revolution fundamentally transformed economies by shifting societies from agrarian systems to industrialized ones, leading to unprecedented increases in productivity. This transformation, however, came at a cost - an exponential rise in greenhouse gas emissions that accelerated global warming and climate change.

In response, significant economic and technological advancements have been made to mitigate the impacts of climate change:

Economic Strategies:
1) Transition to Renewable Energy Sources: The global shift towards renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectricity, geothermal, and bioenergy has gained momentum. Countries are investing heavily in these sectors due to their cleaner nature and decreasing costs over time.
2) Green Economies: Several nations have implemented green policies and economic strategies focusing on sustainable practices. This includes eco-tourism, circular economy models, and carbon pricing mechanisms like cap-and-trade systems or carbon taxes.

Technological Innovations:
1) Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): Technologies that capture CO2 emissions from power plants, factories, and other industrial sources are being developed. Once captured, these greenhouse gases can be stored underground in depleted oil reservoirs or saline aquifers to prevent them from entering the atmosphere.
2) Electric Vehicles: The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has been a game-changer in reducing transportation-related emissions. As battery technology improves and charging infrastructure expands, EVs are becoming more accessible and cost-effective alternatives to traditional gasoline-powered cars.

Adaptive Strategies:
1) Climate Resilient Infrastructure: Developing infrastructure that can withstand the impacts of climate change is crucial for long-term sustainability. This includes improved water management systems, stronger building codes for flood-prone areas, and resilient urban planning strategies.
2) Nature-Based Solutions: Leveraging natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and coral reefs to capture carbon, provide water regulation services, and enhance biodiversity can help mitigate climate change while conserving nature.

In conclusion, the response to climate change has led to a convergence of economic opportunities and technological innovations that are reshaping global development strategies. The pursuit of cleaner energy sources, sustainable practices, and innovative technologies is not only addressing environmental concerns but also promoting economic growth in new domains like renewable energy industries and green jobs. As society continues to adapt and evolve, the integration of these advancements will be essential for building a resilient future.

Please note that this response assumes knowledge of ongoing developments up until writing (2023).
