Climate change is primarily driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with carbon dioxide (CO₂) being the most prevalent due to extensive fossil fuel use. Other significant GHGs include methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). These gases accumulate in the atmosphere, enhancing the Earth's natural greenhouse effect, leading to global warming.

The primary sources of these emissions vary across different industries:

1. **Energy Sector**: This sector is the largest contributor to CO₂ emissions, accounting for about 76% globally. It includes burning coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation, heating, and transportation.

2. **Agriculture**: Methane and nitrous oxide are major contributors here, with methane mainly from enteric fermentation in livestock and manure management. Nitrous oxide is released from the use of synthetic fertilizers.

3. **Industry**: This sector contributes about 25% of global GHG emissions, primarily through fuel combustion, industrial processes (like cement and steel production), and waste processing.

4. **Transportation**: Accounts for around 16% of total CO₂ emissions globally. It includes road transport (cars, trucks), aviation, shipping, and rail.

5. **Waste Management**: Decomposition in landfills produces methane, contributing about 3-5% of global GHG emissions.

6. **Forestry and Land Use Changes**: These activities lead to deforestation and changes in land use, which can release carbon stored in forests and reduce the planet’s capacity for carbon sequestration.

Understanding these sources is crucial for developing targeted strategies to mitigate climate change impacts through policy interventions, technological advancements, and sustainable practices across various sectors.
