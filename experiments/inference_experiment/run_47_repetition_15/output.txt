The technical paper discusses the broad field of artificial intelligence (AI), which encompasses computer systems that exhibit intelligence by perceiving their environment and using learning and reasoning to optimize outcomes. AI applications range from high-profile areas like web search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and superhuman game play, though many are integrated into everyday use without explicit AI labeling due to their widespread adoption.

The paper highlights the various subfields of AI research focused on objectives such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. General intelligence remains an ambitious long-term goal for AI researchers who have adapted techniques from search optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience.

The discipline of AI was established in 1956 but experienced multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment due to funding shortages, known as "AI winter." The field saw a surge after deep learning outperformed previous techniques starting in 2012, which escalated further with the introduction of the transformer architecture. By the early 2020s, AI investments had grown to hundreds of billions of dollars, marking an 'AI boom'. However, AI's widespread use has unveiled unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions on regulatory policies to ensure technology safety and benefits, while addressing concerns about its future risks and effects.
