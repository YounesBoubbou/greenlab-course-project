The paper explores artificial intelligence (AI), defined as computer systems displaying machine intelligence that perceives its environment through learning and uses it for actions aiming at maximizing predefined goals. AI applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction tools like Google Assistant and Alexa, autonomous vehicles like Waymo, generative art creation, and superhuman game analysis. The field is diverse, with subfields focusing on reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, robotics, and aims for general intelligence akin to human performance.

AI techniques such as search optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, and economics are employed in research, with inputs from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, among others. AI was established academically in 1956, experiencing cycles of optimism followed by disillusionment known as 'AI winters.' Interest surged post-2012 due to deep learning's outperformance over previous techniques and has since exponentially grown with the transformer architecture, leading to a significant $100 billion+ investment trend labeled as the AI boom.

Innovations have introduced unintended consequences, highlighted harms in existing practices, and raised concerns about long-term risks. These discussions necessitate regulatory policies ensuring safety and maximizing technology benefits.
