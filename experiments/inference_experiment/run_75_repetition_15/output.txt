## Primary Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions

**Carbon Dioxide:**

* **Power generation:** Thermal power plants, coal-fired power plants, natural gas power plants
* **Transportation:** Cars, trucks, airplanes, shipping
* **Industrial processes:** Cement production, steel production, manufacturing
* **Residential and commercial buildings:** Heating and cooling systems, appliances

**Methane:**

* **Agriculture:** Livestock digestion, manure management, rice cultivation
* **Waste management:** Landfills, sewage treatment plants
* **Fugitive emissions:** Leaks from pipelines and storage facilities

**Nitrous Oxide:**

* **Agriculture:** Soil management practices, livestock digestion
* **Waste management:** Denitrification process in landfills
* **Agriculture and industrial processes:** Use of synthetic fertilizers, fuel combustion

**Variation Across Industries:**

**Power generation:** Highest emissions due to widespread fossil fuel use for electricity generation.

**Transportation:** Significant emissions due to dependence on cars and trucks for transportation.

**Agriculture:** Major emissions from livestock and agricultural practices like manure management and fertilizer use.

**Manufacturing:** Emissions arise from industrial processes like steel production and cement manufacturing.

**Residential and commercial buildings:** Emissions come from energy consumption for heating and cooling.

**Waste management:** Emissions occur during landfill decomposition and wastewater treatment.
