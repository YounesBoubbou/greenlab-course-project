The technical paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science. AI enables machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to achieve defined goals. The field has various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. Traditional goals include achieving general intelligence, which is the ability to complete tasks on an at least equal level as humans. AI researchers have adapted techniques from search and optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The field experienced periods of optimism followed by disappointment and funding loss, known as "AI winter," but saw significant growth after 2012 with the advent of deep learning and transformer architecture, leading to massive investments in AI.
