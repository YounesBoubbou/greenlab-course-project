The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), defining it as machine intelligence that enables computers to perceive environments, learn from experiences, and make decisions towards goal achievement. Key applications include search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools. AI encompasses various subfields with goals like reasoning, learning, and perception, integrating techniques such as neural networks and statistics. Founded in 1956, the field has experienced cycles of growth and setbacks due to funding issues (AI winter). Recent advancements, especially deep learning and transformers, have propelled AI's widespread adoption. However, this growth raises concerns about unintended consequences and ethical risks, leading to discussions on regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
