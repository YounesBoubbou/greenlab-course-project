 Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor. The main sources of GHG emissions are fossil fuel combustion, land use changes, and industrial processes.

Fossil fuel combustion is the largest source of GHG emissions, accounting for approximately 65% of total emissions. This includes emissions from burning coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes. The transportation sector is the second-largest contributor to GHG emissions, primarily due to the combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles.

Other significant sources of GHG emissions include land use changes, such as deforestation and land conversion for agriculture or urban development, which account for around 15% of total emissions. Industrial processes, such as cement production and the manufacturing of chemicals and metals, also emit substantial amounts of GHGs.

The distribution of GHG emissions across different industries varies significantly. The energy sector is the largest emitter, followed by the transportation sector, agriculture, and industry. Within these sectors, there are also significant differences in emission levels, with fossil fuel-based power generation being a major contributor to emissions in the energy sector, while transportation-related emissions come mainly from passenger vehicles and freight transport.

To mitigate climate change, it is essential to reduce GHG emissions across all sectors and industries. This can be achieved through various strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, promoting sustainable land use practices, and implementing carbon capture and storage technologies. Governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to reduce GHG emissions and prevent catastrophic climate change consequences.
