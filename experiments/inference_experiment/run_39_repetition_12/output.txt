Climate change is primarily driven by greenhouse gas emissions that originate from various human activities. The most significant contributor to climate change is carbon dioxide (CO2), which accounts for about 80% of total greenhouse gases.

Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere mainly through fossil fuel combustion in industries like power generation, transportation, and manufacturing. Natural sources such as volcanic eruptions and decomposition of organic matter also contribute to CO2 emissions.

Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are other potent greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Methane is primarily emitted during the production and transport of natural gas, as well as livestock manure management. Nitrous oxide is mainly released from agriculture, particularly fertilizers applied to crops, as well as industrial processes.

Understanding the primary sources and contributions of greenhouse gas emissions across various industries is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate climate change. These strategies might include transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency in industrial processes, and implementing sustainable land management practices.
