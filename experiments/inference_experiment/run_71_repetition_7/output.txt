The paper outlines artificial intelligence (AI) as machine learning aimed at simulating human cognition through goal achievement by environment interaction, with applications spanning web search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, creative tools and strategic games. Despite its integration into common technologies—leading to non-recognition of AI in day-to-day uses due to ubiquity—the field's complexity is underscored by diverse subfields targeting reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, language processing, perception, robotics support and the ambitious quest for general intelligence. These pursuits involve a fusion of methodologies from mathematics, logic, statistics, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience since AI's inception as an academic discipline in 1956—interspersed with cycles including optimism peaks (AI boom) followed by disillusionment periods causing funding cutbacks. Deep learning advancements post-2012 have catalyzed resurgence and exponential investments, reaching hundreds of billions in the early 2020s for AI development while concurrently triggering ethical debates over its unintended consequences such as privacy issues or biases. These concerns are driving calls for regulatory measures to govern safety standards and maximize benefits within society's broader context, reflective of a nuanced balance between technological progressivism and societal responsibility in AI deployment.
