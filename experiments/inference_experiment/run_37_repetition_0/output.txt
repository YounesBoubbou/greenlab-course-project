The response to climate change has not only seen significant technological advancements but also marked key shifts in global economies. Here is a comprehensive summary:

1. Technological Breakthroughs:
   - Renewable Energy: Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power have become increasingly cost-effective and efficient.
   - Energy Storage: Batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, and grid-scale storage systems have advanced significantly, enabling smoother integration of renewable energy sources.
   - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): Technologies to capture carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and store them underground have made significant progress.
   
2. Economic Shifts:
   - Green Jobs: As industries transition to low-carbon technologies, jobs in sectors like renewable energy, energy efficiency, and green construction have emerged.
   - Circular Economy: The push towards reducing waste and increasing resource efficiency has led to new business models that prioritize sustainability.
   
3. International Efforts:
   - Kyoto Protocol (1997): An international treaty that aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It set binding targets for developed countries.
   - Paris Agreement (2015): A comprehensive accord signed by 196 countries, with the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels.

In conclusion, the response to climate change has been marked by significant technological advancements, economic shifts towards sustainability, and international efforts through treaties and agreements.
