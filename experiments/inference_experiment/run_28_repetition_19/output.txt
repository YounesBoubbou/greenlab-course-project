 Renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind power, are essential for combatting climate change due to technological advancements and cost decreases. However, intermittency challenges require energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers use incentives to accelerate transition, but achieving carbon neutrality needs a holistic approach including energy efficiency, infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
