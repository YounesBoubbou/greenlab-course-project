The Industrial Revolution's legacy can be seen in the ongoing struggle against climate change. In response to rising greenhouse gas emissions, economies worldwide have transitioned toward cleaner energy sources and implemented more efficient technologies. The renewable energy sector has grown significantly, driven by declining costs for solar and wind power. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewables now account for over 30% of global electricity generation.

Technological advancements have also played a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Electric vehicles, once considered an expensive luxury item, are becoming increasingly affordable and widespread. The battery technology that powers these vehicles has seen significant improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness, making them a viable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. Additionally, the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies enables industries to reduce their emissions while still producing energy.

Economic incentives have driven many of these advancements. Governments around the world have implemented policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as tax credits for renewable energy investments and subsidies for electric vehicle purchases. The European Union's emission trading system (ETS), for example, has led to a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources.

The economic benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon economy are becoming increasingly evident. A study by the International Renewable Energy Agency found that every dollar invested in renewable energy generates up to four dollars in economic returns. The growth of clean technologies and green industries is also creating new job opportunities, contributing to local economic development and improving quality of life for millions of people worldwide.
