Climate change is predominantly influenced by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) being the most significant contributors. CO2, primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation, transportation, industry, and agriculture, is the leading cause of climate change. The combustion process releases CO2 into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate.

Methane, another potent GHG, predominantly originates from the agricultural sector (mainly through livestock digestion and manure management) and fossil fuel extraction, as well as from natural sources like wetlands and landfills. Methane's warming effect is 28-36 times greater than that of CO2 over a century.

Nitrous oxide, mainly emitted during fertilizer production and use in agriculture, soil management practices, and energy production from fossil fuels, plays a less prominent role compared to CO2 and methane but still contributes significantly to global warming. The release of N2O is associated with 60% of its total radiative forcing coming from agricultural activities.

The industrial sector's contribution varies across countries depending on their level of development and the type of industries they possess. For instance, developed countries often face more significant contributions from energy-intensive manufacturing processes and transportation sectors, while developing nations might have higher emissions due to rapid urbanization and industrial growth.

In summary, GHG emissions are primarily sourced through fossil fuel combustion in electricity generation, transportation, industry operations, agriculture practices such as livestock management and fertilizer application, and waste management activities like landfill gas production. Understanding these sources allows for the development of targeted policies and strategies aimed at reducing emissions across various industries to mitigate climate change effectively.
