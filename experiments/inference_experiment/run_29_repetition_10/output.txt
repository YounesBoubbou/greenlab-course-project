 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions based on defined goals. Applications range from web search engines and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and generative tools. AI research aims for general intelligence, utilizing techniques like search, logic, neural networks, and statistics. Founded in 1956, AI has seen cycles of optimism and disappointment, with recent growth due to deep learning and transformer architecture. Investments reached hundreds of billions by the early 2020s. Unintended consequences and concerns about risks led to discussions on regulatory policies.
