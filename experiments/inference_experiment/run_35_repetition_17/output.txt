 The provided technical paper discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI), a computer science field that develops methods enabling machines to learn and take actions optimally. Key applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, strategy games, etc. AI research targets goals like reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics support. The long-term goal is general intelligence, the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an equal level. Techniques used include search, optimization, logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI has seen cycles of optimism and disappointment since 1956, but funding increased after 2012 with the rise of deep learning, transformer architecture, and recently, massive investments in the AI boom. However, concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and long-term effects have sparked discussions on regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits of the technology.
