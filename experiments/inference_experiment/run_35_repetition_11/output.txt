 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer science field that develops machine systems with learning and intelligence capabilities. Applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and strategy games. AI research aims for general intelligence, using diverse techniques such as optimization, logic, neural networks, and statistics. AI has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment since its inception in 1956, experiencing a resurgence after 2012 with deep learning and the transformer architecture. Investments in AI have grown to hundreds of billions by early 2020s, yet concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and future effects have emerged, leading to discussions on regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
