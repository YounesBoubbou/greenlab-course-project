The Industrial Revolution's impact on greenhouse gas emissions has indeed led to unprecedented global warming concerns. In response, international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015) aimed to reduce emissions through emission caps and market-based mechanisms.

Economic advancements have been a crucial aspect of this response. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, have gained significant traction due to decreasing costs and increasing efficiency. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable energy accounted for 26% of global electricity generation in 2020, up from 21% in 2015.

Technological innovations have also played a vital role. Electric vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular, with many countries investing heavily in EV infrastructure and incentivizing their adoption. The IEA estimates that there will be over 140 million EVs on the road by 2030. Additionally, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has improved significantly, enabling industries to reduce emissions from fossil fuel-based processes.

Furthermore, green technologies have become more cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels. A study by BloombergNEF found that solar energy costs decreased by 73% between 2010 and 2020, while wind power costs dropped by 49%. These developments have encouraged companies and governments to invest in low-carbon infrastructure, fostering a transition towards a more sustainable economy.

While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done. The IEA warns that global carbon emissions need to reach net-zero by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels. Nevertheless, the economic and technological advancements driven by climate change efforts have created a robust foundation for continued innovation and sustainable growth.
