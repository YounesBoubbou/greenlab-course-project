The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) as a broad field that involves developing methods and software for machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions towards defined goals. AI has various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence, or the ability of machines to perform any task on an equal level with humans, is a long-term goal. The paper also discusses the history of AI research, its cycles of optimism and disappointment, and recent breakthroughs such as deep learning and transformer architecture. Furthermore, it highlights the unintended consequences and harms that have emerged from the widespread use of AI in the 21st century and raises concerns about its risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies.
