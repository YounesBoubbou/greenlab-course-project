The provided technical paper outlines Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a multidisciplinary field focused on creating machines that can perceive, learn from their environment, reason, plan, and mimic human-like intelligence. AI applications span various industries such as search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems for YouTube/Amazon/Netflix, virtual assistants (Google Assistant), autonomous vehicles by Waymo, generative creations through tools like ChatGPT or AI art, and strategic games where superhuman performance is achieved. Despite its cutting-edge developments in deep learning since 2012—culminating with the transformer architecture's rise post-2017—the paper acknowledges that many high-tech applications are not perceived as AI due to their commonality and usefulness, blurring what is considered "AI."

Traditional goals for general intelligence include reasoning akin to human capabilities across multiple domains. Researchers pursue these objectives using diverse methods from logic and mathematical optimization through neural networks or statistical approaches with insights drawn from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience among others. AI has had its share of funding ups and downs since 1956—AI winter periods followed by renewed interest leading to an investment surge into the early 2020s (the "AI boom"). However, as AI's role expands in contemporary life, it raises issues about unintended effects. These challenges have led to calls for regulatory measures ensuring safety and beneficial use of artificial intelligence systems while contemplating their future risks.
