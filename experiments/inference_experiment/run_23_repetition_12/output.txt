Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to create machines capable of exhibiting human-like intelligence. AI has a range of applications, including web search engines, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. Despite this, many cutting edge AI is already integrated into everyday life without being labeled as such. AI research encompasses various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics, among others. While general intelligence, or the ability to complete any task humanly possible on an equal level, is a long-term goal, there have been significant advances in recent years, such as deep learning and the transformer architecture, which have garnered interest and funding. However, the widespread use of AI also presents unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
