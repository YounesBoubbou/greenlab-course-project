Greenhouse gas emissions arise from various human activities across diverse industries. 

**Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**, the dominant contributor, stems primarily from:

* **Electricity & Heat Production:** Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for power generation and heating releases massive amounts of CO₂. 
* **Transportation:** Cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes rely heavily on fossil fuels, emitting significant CO₂ during combustion.
* **Industry:** Manufacturing processes, particularly those using fossil fuels for energy or as feedstock, contribute substantially to CO₂ emissions.

**Methane (CH₄)**, a potent greenhouse gas, originates from:

* **Agriculture:** Livestock (particularly cattle) produce methane through digestion, while rice paddies and manure management also release significant amounts.
* **Natural Gas & Oil:** Leaks during extraction, processing, and transportation of natural gas contribute to methane emissions.
* **Waste Management:** Decomposing organic waste in landfills releases methane.

**Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)** arises mainly from:

* **Agriculture:**  Fertilizers containing nitrogen release N₂O into the atmosphere when applied to soils.
* **Industrial Processes:** Some industrial activities, like nitric acid production, emit N₂O as a byproduct.


Understanding these sources is crucial for implementing effective mitigation strategies and transitioning to cleaner energy sources across all sectors.
