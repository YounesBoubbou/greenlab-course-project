 The provided paper delves into Artificial Intelligence (AI), a computer science field that develops methods for machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve goals. Applications range from search engines to autonomous vehicles. AI is integrated across various domains, including robotics, reasoning, natural language processing, and perception. The ultimate goal is general intelligence, but challenges remain in reaching this milestone. Techniques used include search, logic, artificial neural networks, and statistics. AI's journey began in 1956, experiencing cycles of enthusiasm and disappointment (AI winter), until the resurgence of deep learning in 2012. By the early 2020s, investments in AI had reached hundreds of billions of dollars (the AI boom). However, unintended consequences and potential risks have emerged, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
