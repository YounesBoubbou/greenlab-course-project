The adoption of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, has significantly grown due to technological improvements and decreasing costs. However, their intermittent nature requires energy storage and grid integration solutions. Policy incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs are also employed to accelerate the transition. Achieving carbon neutrality necessitates a multifaceted approach combining energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and international cooperation.
