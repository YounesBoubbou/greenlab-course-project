The paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of AI research is to achieve general intelligence, which means completing any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. To reach this goal, AI researchers have adapted and integrated techniques from various fields such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The paper also discusses the history of AI, including its founding in 1956 and multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winter. However, with the emergence of deep learning in 2012 and the transformer architecture in 2017, funding and interest in AI vastly increased, leading to an AI boom. This growth has exposed several unintended consequences and harms, raising concerns about the risks and long-term effects of AI technology.
