Greenhouse gas emissions stem from diverse human activities across various industries.  

**Carbon Dioxide (CO2):** The primary source is **electricity and heat production**, largely reliant on burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. **Transportation**, fueled by gasoline and diesel, is another major contributor. **Industry** processes, including manufacturing and cement production, also release significant CO2. 

**Methane (CH4):**  **Agriculture** is the leading source, particularly livestock raising (enteric fermentation) and rice cultivation. **Natural gas extraction and distribution** are responsible for leaks during production and transportation. **Waste management**, specifically landfills decomposing organic matter, also contributes to methane emissions.

**Nitrous Oxide (N2O):** **Agriculture** again dominates, primarily from fertilizer use and manure management. **Industrial processes**, like nitric acid production, release N2O as a byproduct. 

Variations across industries are notable. The electricity sector accounts for the largest share of global CO2 emissions, while agriculture leads in methane and nitrous oxide emissions.  
Understanding these emission sources is crucial for developing targeted mitigation strategies to curb climate change.
