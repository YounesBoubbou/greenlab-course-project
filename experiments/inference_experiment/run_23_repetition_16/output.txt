The paper provides a broad overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various applications. It explains that AI is a field of research in computer science that aims to develop methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment, learn from experience, and make decisions based on goals. The paper highlights several subfields of AI research, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics, among others. AI also draws upon several other fields such as psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and more. The paper notes that AI has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment over the years, but funding and interest have vastly increased after 2012 with the development of deep learning and transformer architecture. While AI has brought numerous benefits to society, it also presents several unintended consequences and harms, raising concerns about its long-term effects. As a result, discussions about regulatory policies have emerged to ensure the safety and benefits of this technology.
