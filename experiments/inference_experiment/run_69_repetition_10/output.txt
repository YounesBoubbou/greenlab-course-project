The principal greenhouse gas responsible for climate change is carbon dioxide (CO₂), primarily resulting from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These activities are central to the energy sector; power plants generate electricity by combusting these resources but fail to fully convert their potential chemical energy into useful work—leading to CO₂ emissions being released directly into the atmosphere (IEA, 2019).

In contrast, methane (CH₄), another potent greenhouse gas with a more immediate impact on global warming than carbon dioxide per molecule, is mainly produced by two sources within different industries: agriculture and waste management. In the realm of farming—specifically enteric fermentation from livestock like cows (Randolph et al., 2015) — as well as rice paddies where anaerobic conditions facilitate methane production by archaea present in soil and water, significant contributions are made to the overall greenhouse gas emissions.

Finally, nitrous oxide (N₂O), although less prevalent than CO₂ or CH₄ on a global scale, possesses a high warming potential over time after being released into the atmosphere through agricultural soil management—particularly from synthetic fertilizers and manure. The application of these nutrients can lead to N₂O emissions due to microbial processes in soils (Ray et al., 2015).

These three greenhouse gases have various primary sources across distinct industries: the energy sector is a major contributor for CO₂, agriculture leads methane releases—especially from enteric fermentation and rice cultivation—and both synthetic fertilizer application in farming activities result in nitrous oxide emissions.
