 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. Applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools. AI research aims for general intelligence but includes subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. Techniques used include search, logic, neural networks, and statistics. AI was founded in 1956 and has experienced cycles of optimism and funding loss (AI winter) and recent boom due to deep learning and transformer architecture. Unintended consequences and concerns about risks have prompted regulatory discussions.
