The Industrial Revolution's legacy has been far-reaching indeed, with its impacts manifesting in several facets of modern life including economics, society, and environment. The rise in greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most profound outcomes, contributing significantly to global warming. As a direct consequence, countries worldwide have begun acknowledging their role in climate change through various international efforts aimed at reducing carbon footprints.

Among these initiatives are agreements like the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and its successor, the Paris Agreement (2015), which have laid out commitments for developed nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources has become a pivotal area of focus in this context; solar power, wind energy, hydropower, geothermal energy, and biomass are some alternative resources gaining prominence.

Technologically speaking, there's been significant progress too. Innovations like smart grids, which allow for efficient management of electricity supply and demand, have facilitated the integration of intermittent renewable sources into national power systems. Electric vehicles (EVs), powered by zero-emission battery technology, offer sustainable transport alternatives that reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

Economically, transitioning to a low-carbon economy presents challenges as well as opportunities. The green economy has emerged as a new sector with a significant growth potential. Industries like renewable energy manufacturing and installation, sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and clean technologies have gained importance in global economic development plans. However, it requires substantial upfront investments which can be costly for countries with less financial resources.

In conclusion, addressing climate change involves not only reducing carbon emissions but also fostering technological advancements that support sustainable practices across industries. The international community is making progress through collective efforts like the Paris Agreement and individual national actions driven by economic incentives and environmental concerns. It's a process where technology, economics, and politics intertwine to tackle global warming - a monumental challenge for humanity in this era of rapid industrialization.
