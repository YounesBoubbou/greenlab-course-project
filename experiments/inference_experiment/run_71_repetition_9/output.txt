The technical paper provides a comprehensive overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which encompasses machine intelligence replicating human cognitive functions, primarily through computer systems. AI's applications span advanced web search engines like Google Search to autonomous vehicles such as Waymo and generative creative tools including ChatGPT and AI art forms. Despite their pervasive use in everyday technology—often unrecognized for being rooted in cutting-edge AI research—the field has experienced fluctuating funding, marked by periods of optimism followed by disappointment (AI winters). However, post 2012's deep learning breakthrough and the advent of transformer architectures around 2017 saw significant investments soar into hundreds of billions. AI now faces scrutiny due to unintended negative impacts on society today and potential risks in future scenarios; thus, discussions for regulatory measures are intensifying to ensure its safe application while maximizing benefits across diverse sectors like recommendation systems (YouTube/Amazon), virtual assistants such as Siri or Alexa, autonomous vehicle development, strategic game playing enhancement, and creative outputs. The paper underscores AI's interdisciplinary nature with contributions from computer science areas—reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing (NLP), perception, robotics support; as well drawing upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience for comprehensive understanding. Founded in 1956 and experiencing peaks of interest following significant technological advancements like deep learning or transformer architecture developments further emphasizes AI's dynamic evolutionary journey towards achieving generalized intelligence equivalent to humans while grappling with its ethical implications on society at large.
