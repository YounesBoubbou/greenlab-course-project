Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of computer science that focuses on developing methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to achieve defined goals. AI applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an equal level, is also among the long-term goals of AI research. Techniques used in AI research include search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. However, unintended consequences and harms associated with AI have been exposed, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
