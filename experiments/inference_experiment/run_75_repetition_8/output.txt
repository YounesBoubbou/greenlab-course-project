## Primary Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions:

**Carbon Dioxide:**

* **Power generation:** Burning coal, natural gas, and oil releases large amounts of CO2.
* **Transportation:** Vehicles powered by fossil fuels emit CO2 during fuel combustion.
* **Industrial processes:** Production of cement, steel, and other materials releases CO2 as a byproduct.
* **Agriculture:** Livestock digestion and fertilizer use emit CO2.
* **Residential and commercial buildings:** Heating and cooling systems utilize fossil fuels, generating CO2 emissions.


**Methane:**

* **Agriculture:** Methane is emitted during livestock digestion and from anaerobic decomposition of agricultural waste.
* **Waste management:** Decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces methane.
* **Leakage from natural gas infrastructure:** Methane leaks from pipelines and storage facilities.

**Nitrous Oxide:**

* **Agriculture:** Soil management practices and fertilizer use can release nitrous oxide.
* **Wastewater treatment:** Treatment processes can unintentionally emit nitrous oxide.
* **Manure management:** Nitrous oxide can be emitted during the decomposition of animal waste.


**Variations Across Industries:**

* **Power generation:** High emissions from coal-fired power plants.
* **Transportation:** Significant emissions from cars, trucks, and airplanes.
* **Manufacturing:** Emissions vary depending on the manufacturing process, with steel production releasing high amounts of CO2.
* **Agriculture:** Emissions are concentrated in livestock and fertilizer use.
* **Construction:** Emissions arise from equipment use and material production.
