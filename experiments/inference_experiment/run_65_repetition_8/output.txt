The paper outlines artificial intelligence (AI), which is broadly defined as any machine exhibiting intelligent behavior aimed at goal achievement, through environmental perception using learning techniques from computer science with deep roots and varied applications. While AI's subfields focus on specialized tasks like reasoning or robotics assisting in natural language processing, planning, knowledge representation, etc., the ultimate objective is to attain general intelligence equal to human capabilities. Historically experiencing cycles of growth and decline since its establishment as an academic discipline in 1956 (AI winters), AI has witnessed a significant resurgence thanks to deep learning post-2012, further bolstered by transformer architecture advancements around mid-2017. This period saw substantial investment and integration of diverse techniques from search algorithms to statistical methods across research domains intersecting psychology, linguistics, philosophy, etc. However, AI's expansion into daily life has unveiled negative outcomes necessitating regulation discourse due to safety concerns and uncertain long-term effects. Despite its potential for harmful consequences when misused or misunderstood by the public as mere algorithms rather than sophisticated software systems with learning capabilities, it remains a critical tool in modern societyâ€™s progressive technological landscape that demands nuanced appreciation of both benefits and risks associated with AI applications.
