Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor due to its abundance from human activities. Other potent GHGs like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) also play substantial roles. The primary sources of these emissions vary across different industries:

1. **Energy Sector**: This is the largest source, responsible for about 76% of global CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas in power plants, industrial facilities, vehicles, and buildings.

2. **Agriculture, Forestry, and Land Use**: These sectors contribute around 24% of total GHG emissions globally. Agriculture produces methane from livestock and manure management, while forestry activities result in CO2 emissions through deforestation and land use changes. 

3. **Industrial Processes**: Industrial processes account for about 18-25% of global GHG emissions. These include the production of cement, steel, chemicals, and other industrial products that release significant amounts of CO2 as well as other gases like HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons).

4. **Waste Management**: This sector is responsible for around 6% of global GHG emissions, with landfills being a major source due to the decomposition of organic waste producing methane.

5. **Transportation**: Emissions from transportation contribute about 13-15% of total CO2 emissions globally, primarily from the use of fossil fuels in cars, trucks, ships, and planes.

The sources of GHG emissions are diverse and complex, requiring tailored mitigation strategies across different sectors to effectively address climate change.
