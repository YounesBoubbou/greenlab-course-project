 Renewable energy is growing rapidly due to technological advancements and decreasing costs. However, its intermittency poses a challenge for energy systems. Energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies are needed to support it. Policymakers have implemented incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs. Achieving carbon neutrality will require energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
