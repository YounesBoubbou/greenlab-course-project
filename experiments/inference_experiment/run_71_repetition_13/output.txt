The paper highlights that artificial intelligence (AI), which embodies machine learning capabilities enabling machines like computers to perceive their environment, make decisions, learn from experiences, has significant real-world applications such as search engines and autonomous vehicles. Despite its integration into daily life products often not explicitly labeled "AI", it is a transformative technology that draws on multiple disciplines including psychology, linguistics, neuroscience among others for reasoning, knowledge representation, learning etc., with the ultimate goal of achieving general intelligence equivalent to humans at any task. AI research has experienced fluctuations since its inception as an academic field - periods of optimism followed by funding cuts and renewed interest due to deep-learning breakthroughs post 2012, leading up to the current investment boom with hundreds of billions dedicated annually. However, AI's widespread use has brought unintended consequences like ethical issues concerning privacy invasion or job displacement among others prompting calls for regulatory policies towards mitigating risks and ensuring its benefits outweigh harms in the long term.
