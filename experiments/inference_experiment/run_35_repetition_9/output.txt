 The provided technical paper discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI), a field of computer science that aims to develop machines capable of perceiving their environment, learning, and taking actions to achieve defined goals. It highlights common AI applications like web search engines, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. However, many AI advancements are now integrated into general use without the 'AI' label. The paper outlines the traditional goals of AI research, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. It also mentions the long-term goal of general intelligence, achieved through integrating various techniques such as search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The paper also covers the history of AI, including its cycles of optimism and disappointment (AI winter), and its recent growth due to advancements in deep learning and transformer architectures (AI boom). Lastly, it touches upon the unintended consequences and potential risks of widespread AI use, leading to discussions about regulatory policies.
