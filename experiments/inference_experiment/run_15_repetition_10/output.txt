The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions vary across different industries, but can be broadly categorized into three sectors: energy, industry, and agriculture.

**Energy Sector:** Fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation, transportation, and heating accounts for approximately 65% of global CO2 emissions. The main contributors are:

* Electricity generation (42%): coal-fired power plants emit the largest share of CO2
* Transportation (22%): gasoline-powered vehicles, airplanes, and ships release significant amounts of CO2
* Industry (17%): fossil fuel combustion for industrial processes and manufacturing

**Industry Sector:** Industrial activities such as cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical processing contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The main sources are:

* Cement production: calcination process releases CO2
* Steel manufacturing: iron ore reduction process emits CO2 and methane
* Chemical processing: production of ammonia, methanol, and other chemicals

**Agriculture Sector:** Livestock farming, especially beef and lamb production, contributes to methane emissions (14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions). Rice cultivation and fertilization also release nitrous oxide.

The emission profiles vary across industries due to differences in energy consumption patterns, technology adoption rates, and production processes. To mitigate climate change, transitioning to renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and implementing sustainable practices in agriculture can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
