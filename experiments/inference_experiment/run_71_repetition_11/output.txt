The technical paper highlights artificial intelligence (AI) as a multidisciplinary field involving computer systems that emulate human-like reasoning, learning, perception, planning, knowledge representation, natural language processing and robotics. AI has progressed significantly since its inception in the mid-20th century through various cycles of high expectations followed by disappointments due to setbacks such as insufficiently powerful algorithms or limited computational resources—known collectively as 'AI winter.' The recent surge back into prominence and funding began with breakthrough successes using deep learning techniques post-2012, further amplified after the introduction of transformer architectures in 2017. These innovations have led to AI's integration across industries—like web search engines (Google), recommendation systems on major platforms like YouTube and Amazon, voice assistants such as Google Assistant or Siri/Alexa; autonomous vehicles by Waymo; creative tools exemplified in ChatGPT with its generative capabilities. However, widespread AI use also unveiled several negative impacts including privacy concerns, algorithmic bias and the risk of over-dependence on technology leading to crucial societal discussions about regulatory policies for safe advancement without compromising benefits. The paper signifies an era where billions are invested in realizing AI's potential while mitigating risks associated with its rapid growth—the current phase, often referred as the 'AI boom.'
