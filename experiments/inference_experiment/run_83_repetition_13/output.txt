This paper outlines artificial intelligence (AI), its applications, historical development, and contemporary challenges. AI encompasses machines mimicking human intelligence through learning and problem-solving, evident in applications like search engines, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.

Despite widespread use, AI often goes unnoticed as it becomes integrated into common technologies. The field's evolution has seen periods of optimism and funding setbacks (AI winters), followed by a resurgence driven by deep learning advancements after 2012.  

Today, AI faces scrutiny due to unintended consequences and potential risks, prompting discussions about ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure responsible development and deployment.
