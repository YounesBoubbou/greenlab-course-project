Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor due to fossil fuel combustion. CO2 accounts for approximately 65% of total GHG emissions, followed by methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).

The primary sources of these emissions can be broadly categorized into two sectors: the industrial sector and the transportation sector. The industrial sector includes activities such as energy production, cement production, and industrial processes, while the transportation sector includes activities such as fuel combustion from vehicles, aircraft, and ships.

Within the industrial sector, the largest source of GHG emissions comes from the burning of fossil fuels for energy production, particularly coal, oil, and natural gas. Cement production is also a significant contributor, with the process of cement manufacturing releasing large amounts of CO2 and CH4.

In the transportation sector, the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, aircraft, and ships is the largest source of GHG emissions. The use of gasoline and diesel fuel for transportation is a significant contributor to these emissions, with the transportation sector accounting for approximately 14% of total GHG emissions.

Other industries such as agriculture, waste management, and land use changes also contribute to GHG emissions, although to a lesser extent than the industrial and transportation sectors. For example, the production and transportation of food can lead to methane emissions from livestock and rice paddies, while deforestation and land use changes can lead to the release of stored carbon into the atmosphere.

To address climate change, it is important to reduce GHG emissions across all sectors. This can be achieved through a variety of measures such as increasing energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving agricultural practices, and implementing policies to reduce emissions.
