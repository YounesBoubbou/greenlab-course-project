The provided paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, goals, and techniques. The paper highlights that AI has filtered into many general applications without being labeled as such, indicating the widespread adoption of AI technologies. The paper also discusses the long-term goals of AI research, including achieving general intelligence, and the various techniques used to reach these goals, such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The paper notes that AI has gone through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winters, but funding and interest have increased significantly since 2012 with the development of deep learning techniques. However, the widespread use of AI has also exposed several unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
