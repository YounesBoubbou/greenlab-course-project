The technical paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science. AI enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. Key subfields include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal is general intelligence, which allows machines to complete tasks performed by humans on an equal level. To achieve this, AI researchers have adapted various techniques from fields like mathematics, logic, statistics, and economics. The field has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment, with a surge in funding and interest after 2012 due to deep learning advancements. However, the widespread use of AI has also exposed unintended consequences and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies.
