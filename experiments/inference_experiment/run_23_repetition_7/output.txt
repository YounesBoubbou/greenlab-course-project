The provided technical paper gives an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various applications. AI is defined as machines exhibiting intelligence, with goals such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The field of AI research encompasses many techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI has been founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and has gone through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment. However, interest and funding in the field have increased significantly after 2012 with the development of deep learning and the transformer architecture. The widespread use of AI in the 21st century has exposed unintended consequences and harms, raising concerns about its risks and long-term effects. This has led to discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
