The paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of research that enables machines to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. AI encompasses various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. Researchers have adapted techniques from multiple disciplines, such as mathematics, statistics, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience, to develop AI systems. The field has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment, with a significant growth in funding after 2012 due to the success of deep learning and the transformer architecture. However, this growth has also exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of AI technology. The long-term goal is to achieve general intelligence, where machines can complete any task performable by humans on an at least equal level.
