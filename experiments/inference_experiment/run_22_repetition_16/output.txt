Renewable energy sources are crucial for global climate change strategies, with solar and wind power experiencing growth due to technology improvements and declining costs. However, their intermittency requires energy storage technologies and grid integration. Policymakers use incentives to speed up the transition. To achieve carbon neutrality, a holistic approach is needed that includes energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international cooperation.
