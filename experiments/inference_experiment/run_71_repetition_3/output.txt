The paper highlights artificial intelligence (AI) as a multidisciplinary field focused on creating machines with learning capabilities that mimic human cognition, aiming at goal achievement through environmental interaction and decision-making. AI's wide application spectrum includes enhanced web search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems in YouTube/Amazon/Netflix, voice assistants (Google Assistant), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), generative tools (ChatGPT, AI art) alongside superior performance in strategy games. Not all of these implementations are widely recognized as AI due to their ubiquity and integration into everyday life—so much so that they've become commoditized beyond the label 'AI'.

The core research areas include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning (with a significant pivot towards deep learning post-2017), natural language processing, perception, robotics. The evolution of AI involves synthesis and adaptation from various methodologies like optimization algorithms, formal logic systems to statistical methods with applications in economics or psychology intertwined into its fabric for generalized problem solving approaches—all aimed at emulating human-level intelligence ('General Intelligence').

Tracing back since 1956 as an academic discipline and facing fluctuating fundings leading to 'AI winters', AI witnessed a resurgence post the deep learning breakthrough in recent years. The current exponential growth of investment into AI, termed the "AI boom", has not been without its drawbacks: unintended consequences and potential risks that necessitate policy discussions for regulation to balance safety with technological benefits. This paper underscores both historical contextual evolution as well as contemporary challenges facing this burgeoning field at large scale deployment, framing AI's impact on society within the discourse of ethical considerations and its future trajectory shaped by human intervention and policy-making mechanisms to mitigate risks.
