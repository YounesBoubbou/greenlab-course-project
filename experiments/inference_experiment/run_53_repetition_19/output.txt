Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field within computer science that focuses on enabling machines to exhibit intelligence through perception, learning, and goal achievement. AI applications range from web search engines and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and generative tools like ChatGPT. Traditional research goals include reasoning, knowledge representation, and natural language processing. Techniques vary widely, from formal logic and neural networks to statistics and operations research. Since 2012, deep learning has driven significant advancements, with the transformer architecture further accelerating progress by 2017. However, AI's widespread use has raised ethical concerns about unintended consequences, prompting discussions on regulatory policies for safety and benefits.
