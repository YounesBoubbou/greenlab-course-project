 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of research in computer science that develops methods and software for machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions towards achieving defined goals. This includes advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence is among the long-term goals of AI research, but it has not been achieved yet. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields to reach its goals. Funding and interest in AI have gone through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, but the recent growth accelerated with the transformer architecture, resulting in billions of dollars being invested in AI. The widespread use of AI has also raised concerns about its unintended consequences and long-term effects. To ensure the safety and benefits of AI, regulatory policies are necessary.
