The paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of AI research is to achieve general intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. To reach this goal, AI researchers have adapted and integrated various techniques, such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The paper also discusses the history of AI, including its founding in 1956 and multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winters. Finally, the paper notes that the widespread use of AI in the 21st century has exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
