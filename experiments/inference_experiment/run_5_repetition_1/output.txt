The paper provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI) research, including its goals, techniques, and subfields. The field of AI has evolved since its inception in 1956, with multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment known as "AI winters." However, recent advancements in deep learning have led to a significant increase in funding and interest, resulting in the current "AI boom." The widespread use of AI has also raised concerns about its potential risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safe and beneficial use of the technology. Key insights from the paper include the diverse range of techniques used in AI research, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to AI, drawing upon fields such as psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and more.
