The primary sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions include:

1. **Fossil Fuel Combustion**: The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), which accounts for about 65% of global GHG emissions.
2. **Agriculture**: Livestock production, especially beef and lamb, leads to methane (CH4) emissions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is also released from fertilizers used in agricultural processes.
3. **Land-Use Changes**: Deforestation and land degradation release carbon stored in vegetation and soils, contributing to global warming.

Across different industries, the sources of GHG emissions vary:

1. **Energy Sector**: Power plants, industrial processes, and transportation account for a significant share of CO2 emissions.
2. **Agriculture and Forestry**: Animal husbandry, fertilizer use, and deforestation contribute to N2O and CH4 emissions.
3. **Industrial Processes**: Cement production, steel manufacturing, and other industries release large amounts of CO2.

The industrial sector is responsible for:

* 21% of global GHG emissions (Energy Information Administration)
* 10-15% of global GHG emissions (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change)

To mitigate climate change, it's essential to reduce GHG emissions from these primary sources through energy efficiency measures, renewable energy adoption, sustainable agriculture practices, and responsible land-use planning.
