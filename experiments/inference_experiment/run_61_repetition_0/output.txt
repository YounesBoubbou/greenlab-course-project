The Industrial Revolution ushered an era characterized by unprecedented growth but also marked significant environmental impact, most notably through a drastic increase in greenhouse gas emissions leading to global warming and climate change. Despite years of international efforts like the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and more recent Paris Agreement (2015), addressing these issues has been an ongoing struggle that continues into present times, underscored by both economic considerations and technological advancements as part of climate change mitigation strategies.

Economically speaking, the transition towards a low-carbon future is seen in increased investments in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydroelectricity, and bioenergy - industries that have been expanding rapidly to replace fossil fuels as primary power generators worldwide. Subsidies for these green technologies aimed at making them more competitive with traditional methods of electricity generation are being implemented by governments across the globe in an effort to reduce carbon footprint and adhere closely to international climate change agreements.

Furthermore, economic restructuring has led to innovative financial instruments like green bonds – a form of fixed-income securities designed specifically for funding projects that have positive environmental benefits - which are being increasingly utilized worldwide as part of financing efforts towards sustainable development.

On the technological front, breakthroughs in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology hold promising potential to curb emissions from industrial sectors where alternatives might not be readily available or economically viable yet - especially within energy production processes like coal-fired power plants. Although still at nascent stages of development due to high costs, research into CCS is gaining momentum as a complementary strategy in reducing global carbon footprints alongside renewable adoption and efficiency improvements across industries.

Another significant advancement has been the rise of smart grids - sophisticated energy distribution systems that efficiently manage electricity flow to balance demand with supply, often integrating multiple sources including renewables for optimized power generation while minimizing wastage – essential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy production.

In terms of transportation advancements aimed at addressing the environmental impacts associated with climate change, major strides have been made through developing electric vehicles (EVs) and fuel-efficient conventional cars backed by governmental policies globally to promote their adoption over traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles. 

Finally, advancements in material science leading towards more energy efficient buildings - the sector contributing a significant share of global emissions – are continuously evolving with better insulation and innovative materials that regulate indoor temperature without excessive reliance on heating/cooling systems powered by fossil fuels.

While economic restructuring towards environmentally friendly practices remains an uphill battle against entrenched industrial norms, these various technological advancements present promising avenues for combating the legacy of climate change that began in the Industrial Revolution era and continue to this day with concerted global efforts.
