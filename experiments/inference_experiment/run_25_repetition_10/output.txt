 The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century and continued through the 19th century, brought about unprecedented economic growth and technological advancements. However, these developments came at a significant cost to the environment, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of fossil fuels for transportation, industry, and heating became widespread during this period, leading to a steep increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere (EPA, 2019).

The concentration of these gases has been linked to global warming, which is causing a range of negative impacts on the planet. These include melting glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels, more frequent and extreme weather events, and negative effects on agriculture and water resources (NASA, 2019). Recognizing the severity of this issue, international efforts to address climate change have gained momentum in recent decades.

One response has been the development of cleaner technologies. For instance, renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower have become increasingly cost-effective and efficient. In 2019, renewables accounted for over 70% of new power capacity additions worldwide (IRENA, 2020). Furthermore, advancements in energy storage technologies have made it possible to store excess renewable energy for use during periods of high demand.

Another area of focus has been the promotion of energy efficiency and conservation. This includes improvements in insulation, lighting, and heating systems, as well as the adoption of more energy-efficient practices in industries and transportation (EIA, 2019). For example, LED bulbs use up to 80% less electricity than traditional incandescent bulbs (DOE, 2020), while electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly competitive with gasoline-powered cars due to advances in battery technology and charging infrastructure.

Governments have also played a role in addressing climate change through economic policies such as carbon pricing and subsidies for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Carbon pricing, which puts a financial cost on emitting greenhouse gases, is designed to incentivize businesses and individuals to reduce their emissions (EC, 2019). Subsidies, on the other hand, help make clean technologies more affordable and accessible (IRENA, 2020).

These economic and technological advancements are essential for addressing climate change while also promoting sustainable growth. However, more action is needed to fully transition away from fossil fuels and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero levels by mid-century (UNFCCC, 2015). This will require continued innovation, investment in clean technologies, and international cooperation.
