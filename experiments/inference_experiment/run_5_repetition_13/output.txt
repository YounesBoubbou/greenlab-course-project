The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The paper also discusses the long-term goal of AI research, which is to achieve general intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. The paper highlights the adaptability and integration of techniques from various fields, such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. Additionally, the paper mentions the history of AI, including its founding in 1956 and subsequent cycles of optimism and disappointment, as well as the current growth and investment in AI, which has raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects.
