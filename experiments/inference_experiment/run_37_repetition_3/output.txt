The Industrial Revolution marked a significant turning point in human history, bringing about profound changes across various aspects of society. However, this era was not without its environmental consequences.

One lasting impact of the Industrial Revolution is the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. These gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat from Earth's surface, leading to global warming and climate change.

In response to these challenges, various international efforts have been launched to address climate change. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set targets for countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by specific percentages. However, the protocol was not widely ratified.

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, built upon the Kyoto Protocol and aimed to significantly reduce global warming by limiting the temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The agreement requires countries to submit their own climate change mitigation plans.

As part of these responses, significant economic and technological advancements have been made. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, have seen enormous growth. These technologies not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also create new industries and jobs.

In addition, energy efficiency measures have been implemented across various sectors, including buildings, transportation, and manufacturing. These improvements in energy usage lead to significant reductions in overall energy consumption.

Furthermore, research and development in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies are ongoing. CCUS aims to capture CO2 emissions from industrial processes or power plants and either store them underground or utilize them for other purposes.

In conclusion, the response to climate change has led to significant economic and technological advancements. Renewable energy sources, energy efficiency measures, and research in carbon capture technologies have all played crucial roles in mitigating climate change.
