 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that enables machines to learn from experience and perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. Applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and strategy games. AI research aims for general intelligence. Techniques used include search algorithms, logic, neural networks, statistics, and integration of psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and economics. AI's history is marked by cycles of optimism and disappointment, starting in 1956, with recent significant growth since 2012 due to deep learning and transformer architecture. Widespread use raised concerns about unintended consequences and future risks, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
