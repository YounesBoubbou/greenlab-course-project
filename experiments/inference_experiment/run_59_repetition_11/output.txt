 Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field that seeks to develop machines with the ability to perceive their environment, learn from it, and take actions to achieve specific goals. It includes applications like advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition tools, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools. AI research draws on various disciplines such as computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy. The field has seen multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, with funding and interest in AI fluctuating over time. Deep learning and the transformer architecture have been game-changers for AI, leading to a significant increase in investment. However, the widespread use of AI also raises concerns about its unintended consequences and long-term effects.
