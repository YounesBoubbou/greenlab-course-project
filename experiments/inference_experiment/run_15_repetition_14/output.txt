The primary sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be broadly categorized into energy, industry, transportation, agriculture, and waste management sectors.

**Energy Sector:**
Fossil fuel combustion in power plants and industrial processes accounts for approximately 65% of global GHG emissions. The main contributors are:

* Coal-fired power plants
* Oil refineries
* Natural gas processing

**Industry Sector:**
Industrial processes, such as cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical processing, release significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The main contributors are:

* Cement production
* Steel manufacturing
* Chemical processing

**Transportation Sector:**
Fossil fuel combustion in transportation contributes to about 17% of global GHG emissions. The main contributors are:

* Road transport (cars, trucks)
* Aviation
* Maritime shipping

**Agriculture and Waste Management Sectors:**
Livestock farming and manure management release methane, while agricultural activities like fertilizer use lead to nitrous oxide emissions. Additionally, waste management practices, such as landfills, contribute to methane emissions.

The variation in GHG emissions across industries is significant, with the energy sector being the largest contributor. However, industrial processes, transportation, agriculture, and waste management also play substantial roles. To mitigate climate change, reducing emissions from these sectors requires concerted efforts from governments, industries, and individuals alike.
