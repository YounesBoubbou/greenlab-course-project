 Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have been critical for climate change efforts but are intermittent and need storage and grid integration strategies. Policymakers offer incentives to encourage adoption, but achieving carbon neutrality requires holistic solutions such as energy efficiency and sustainable infrastructure development. Collaboration is also crucial.
