 Global climate change combat relies on renewable energy (renewables), particularly solar & wind power, due to technological advancements and cost reductions. Intermittency is a challenge, so energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies are crucial. Policymakers use incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs for transition acceleration. Achieving carbon neutrality necessitates a comprehensive approach including energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and international cooperation.
