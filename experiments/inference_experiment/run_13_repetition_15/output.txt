The Industrial Revolution's legacy of greenhouse gas emissions has driven international cooperation to mitigate its effects. The Kyoto Protocol (1997) and Paris Agreement (2015) set binding targets for emission reductions, catalyzing a global shift towards low-carbon economies.

Economic advancements in response to climate change have been multifaceted:

1.  **Renewable energy expansion**: Solar and wind power capacities have increased significantly, driven by declining costs and government incentives.
2.  **Energy efficiency improvements**: Buildings, appliances, and industrial processes are being optimized for reduced energy consumption, lowering emissions per unit of production.
3.  **Carbon pricing mechanisms**: Cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes, and other market-based approaches have been implemented to internalize the environmental costs of greenhouse gas emissions.

Technological innovations have also played a crucial role:

1.  **Electrification of transportation**: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular, driven by government subsidies, declining battery costs, and growing consumer demand.
2.  **Carbon capture and storage (CCS)**: Industrial-scale CCS projects are being developed to reduce emissions from fossil fuel power plants and industrial processes.
3.  **Sustainable infrastructure development**: Green buildings, smart grids, and climate-resilient infrastructure are being designed and constructed to minimize environmental impacts.

These developments demonstrate the growing recognition of the need for urgent action on climate change. As governments, businesses, and individuals invest in low-carbon technologies and practices, we can expect continued economic growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
