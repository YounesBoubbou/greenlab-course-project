## Primary Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Industry:

**1. Energy Production & Supply:**

* Fossil fuel power plants emit large quantities of carbon dioxide.
* Coal-fired plants emit significantly more than natural gas or renewables.
* Emissions from refineries and fuel transportation also contribute.


**2. Transportation:**

* Vehicles powered by gasoline or diesel fuel emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
* Heavy transport, aviation, and shipping contribute disproportionately to emissions.
* Emission standards and fuel efficiency regulations can influence the impact.


**3. Industry & Manufacturing:**

* Industrial processes like steelmaking, cement production, and chemical manufacturing release greenhouse gases.
* Process-related emissions from industries vary widely.
* Energy generation for industrial activities also contributes significantly.


**4. Agriculture:**

* Livestock digestion and manure management release methane.
* Agricultural practices like fertilizer use and agricultural burning emit nitrous oxide.
* Changes in agricultural practices can reduce emissions.


**5. Construction:**

* Building materials and energy consumption during construction emit greenhouse gases.
* Embodied carbon in materials and transportation emissions contribute to the total.


**Variations Across Industries:**

* **High-emitting industries:** Energy production, transportation, and manufacturing are the biggest emitters.
* **Emerging economies:** Rapid industrialization in developing countries leads to increased emissions.
* **Developing countries:** Transitioning towards renewable energy can reduce emissions.
* **Specific processes:** Emissions from cement production are high due to the use of fossil fuels and limestone.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Emissions can be mitigated through technological advancements, process changes, and renewable energy adoption.
* Policy instruments like carbon taxes and regulations can influence emission patterns.
* Carbon capture and storage technologies are still under development but hold potential for mitigation.
