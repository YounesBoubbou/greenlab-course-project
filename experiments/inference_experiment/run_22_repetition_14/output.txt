Renewable energy sources have been crucial in combatting climate change, with solar and wind power seeing growth due to technology advancements and decreasing costs. However, their intermittency presents a challenge, prompting the development of energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers use incentives such as tax credits and feed-in tariffs to speed up the transition. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach that includes energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
