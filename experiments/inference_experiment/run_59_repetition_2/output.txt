 Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of research that focuses on developing methods and software to enable machines to learn from their environment and use this knowledge to achieve specific goals. It includes various subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics, which aim to create intelligent machines capable of reasoning, planning, and performing tasks that require human-like intelligence. AI has been used in a variety of high-profile applications, including web search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, and strategy games, among others. However, the widespread adoption of AI has also raised concerns about its potential risks and unintended consequences, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure that the technology is safe and beneficial for society.
