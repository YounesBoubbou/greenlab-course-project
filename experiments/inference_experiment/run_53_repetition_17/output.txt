The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), defining it as machine intelligence that allows systems to perceive environments, learn, and act towards achieving goals. Key applications include web searches, recommendation systems, voice interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategic game analysis. AI research focuses on subfields like reasoning, learning, natural language processing, and robotics. It has seen cycles of optimism and disappointment, with a resurgence in interest post-2012 due to deep learning advancements and the transformer architecture by 2020s. Widespread use also brought ethical concerns about unintended consequences, leading to discussions on regulatory policies for AI safety and benefits.
