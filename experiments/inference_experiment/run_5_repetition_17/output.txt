The paper provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI) research, including its goals, techniques, and applications. The field of AI encompasses various subfields such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence, the ability to complete any task performable by a human, is among the long-term goals of AI research. AI has been influenced by techniques from search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The paper also discusses the history of AI, including its founding in 1956, cycles of optimism and disappointment, and recent growth due to deep learning and the transformer architecture. However, the widespread use of AI has raised concerns about unintended consequences and potential risks, leading to discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
