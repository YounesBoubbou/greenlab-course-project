The technical paper summarizes that artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses machine learning processes allowing computers or systems to interact with their environment, learn from data, and take actions towards achremed objectives—activities often associated with human-like cognition. Notable AI applications include web search engines like Google Search; content recommendation on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube's Discover tab & Netflix’s suggestions; virtual assistants such as Siri or Alexa; autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative tools for art and media creation exemplified by ChatGPT; alongside superhuman strategy game performance in domains like chess with DeepMind's AlphaGo, etc. Despite its ubiquity in consumer technology today—often unnoticed as AI due to normalization of these advancements —AI is a multifaceted academic field founded on reasoning, knowledge representation, planning and learning (among others). Key techniques used for achieving intelligence include artificial neural networks, logic-based methods, economics/operations research approaches. The paper further highlights the oscillating history of AI funding—from initial optimism to periods dubbed as 'AI winter', with significant resurgence post 2017's transformer architecture breakthrough causing an exponential increase in investments (the ‘AI boom’). However, rapid growth has also raised concerns about potential unintended consequences and risks. These range from misinformation spread to biases within AI systems; with consequent calls for effective regulatory policies ensuring the safety of widespread use while harnessing its benefits efficiently.
