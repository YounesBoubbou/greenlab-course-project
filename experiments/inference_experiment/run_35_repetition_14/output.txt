 The paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a field within computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions based on defined goals. Applications range from web search engines and voice assistants to autonomous vehicles and creative tools. AI is integrated into everyday technology without being labeled as such due to increased use and commonality. Goals of AI research include reasoning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics, with the long-term aim of achieving general intelligence on a par with humans. Techniques employed include search algorithms, formal logic, neural networks, and methods from statistics, operations research, and economics. AI has experienced cycles of optimism followed by disappointment, known as "AI winter," but interest and funding significantly increased after 2012 due to advancements in deep learning and transformer architectures. The widespread use of AI has raised concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and future effects, sparking discussions on regulatory policies for safety and benefits.
