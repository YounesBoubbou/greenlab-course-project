 Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field that focuses on developing computer systems with the ability to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to achieve defined goals. These machines are referred to as AIs and can be found in high-profile applications such as web search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategic games. AI research is centered around different subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of AI research is to create machines with general intelligence that can perform any task on an at least equal level as humans. To achieve this goal, AI researchers have adapted various techniques such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. Additionally, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields are also used in the development of AI. The discipline was founded in 1956, and since then, it has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, commonly known as AI winters. Funding and interest increased significantly after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous techniques. This growth further accelerated after 2017 with the development of the transformer architecture, resulting in billions of dollars being invested in AI. The widespread use of AI has raised concerns about its unintended consequences and long-term effects on society, leading to discussions about regulatory policies for safety and benefits.
