The paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of AI research is to achieve general intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. AI has adapted and integrated techniques from various fields such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The paper also discusses the history of AI, including multiple cycles of optimism followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. However, with the emergence of deep learning, funding and interest in AI vastly increased after 2012, leading to an AI boom. The widespread use of AI has exposed several unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
