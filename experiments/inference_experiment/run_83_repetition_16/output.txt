This paper provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI), encompassing its definition, history, applications, and challenges.  

AI enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and act intelligently to achieve specific goals. Applications range from search engines and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and creative tools. While AI has evolved significantly, achieving "general intelligence" remains a long-term objective. 

The field has experienced periods of both growth and stagnation, with a recent boom fueled by deep learning and transformer architectures.  However, the widespread adoption of AI has also raised concerns about unintended consequences and potential risks, prompting discussions on regulations to ensure its safe and beneficial development.
