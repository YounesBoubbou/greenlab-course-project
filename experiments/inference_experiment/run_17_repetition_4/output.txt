The paper discusses the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its evolution. AI is defined as a field that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve goals. Subfields include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal is general intelligence, where machines can complete tasks performed by humans on an equal level. AI researchers have adapted various techniques from math, logic, statistics, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience to reach these goals. The field experienced "AI winter" periods of disappointment and loss of funding before the resurgence of deep learning in 2012 and the transformer architecture in 2017, leading to massive investments in AI (the AI boom). However, this growth has also raised concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and risks, prompting discussions on regulatory policies for its safe development.
