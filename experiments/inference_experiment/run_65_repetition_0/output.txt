The paper emphasizes that AI's roots are grounded not only in computer science but also integrate knowledge from various other fields such as psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience to achieve general intelligence and solve complex tasks. High-profile applications of AI have become ubiquitous across numerous sectors; however, many advanced tools developed by cutting-edge research are no longer associated with the term 'AI.' The paper discusses key subfields in AI including reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, natural language processing, and robotics. Traditional goals for AI involve replicating human intelligence to match or surpass it; henceforth techniques like search algorithms, formal logic, neural networks along with statistics-based methods are frequently utilized by researchers. Historically, the discipline has experienced cycles of growth and decline known as 'AI winter.' Interest burgeoned after 2012 due to deep learning advancements and further escalated post-2017 following transformer architectures that sparked an AI boom in investment by early 2020s. However, the pervasive use of AI has also led to its unintended consequences necessitating regulatory policies for safety assurance and mitigation of potential risks it poses long-term into society's future.
