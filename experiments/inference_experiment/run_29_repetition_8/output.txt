 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that enables machines to learn from their environment and take actions based on defined goals. Applications range from search engines and recommendation systems to robotics and generative tools. AI research includes traditional goals like reasoning, learning, and perception. Techniques include optimization, logic, neural networks, and statistics. Founded in 1956, AI experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment, with renewed interest since 2012 due to deep learning and transformer architectures. Widespread use raised concerns about unintended consequences and future risks, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
