The provided technical paper explores the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its development over time. Key insights include: AI is a subfield of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. Applications of AI range from web search engines to autonomous vehicles and generative tools. However, many common applications are not labeled as AI. Research focuses on traditional goals such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, and natural language processing. To reach these goals, researchers have adapted various techniques, including artificial neural networks and statistical methods. The field has experienced multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, with a significant increase in funding after 2012 due to the emergence of deep learning and transformer architecture. Today, AI raises concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and long-term effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies for its safety and benefits.
