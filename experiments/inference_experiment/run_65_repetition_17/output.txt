The article offers a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI), detailing its evolution from foundational research goals like reasoning and learning, through various subfields such as natural language processing and robotics, to present-day deep learning techniques that have led to the AI boom. Key insights include advancements in web search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, strategy games, and widespread integration into everyday applications without explicit labeling as "AI". The paper also acknowledges periods of optimism (AI winter) juxtaposed with recent investments spurred by breakthroughs like the transformer architecture. It highlights both benefits realized through these advancements—improved efficiency and convenience in numerous sectors—and concerns regarding unintended consequences, safety risks, ethical considerations, job displacement fears, misinformation proliferation, potential biases within AI systems due to training data, privacy intrusions, loss of human expertise skills, manipulation by malicious actors exploiting algorithmic vulnerabilities in social media platforms and autonomous vehicles. These concerns have prompted discussions around regulatory measures ensuring responsible development and deployment of AI technologies that consider societal impacts while mitigating risks for future generations' safety and benefit from this technology.
