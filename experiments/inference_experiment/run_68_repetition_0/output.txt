Remember that these are the official capitals and political centers for each country within their respective national contexts as recognized by them or through international standards. 

Note: Kosovo, which has declared independence from Yugoslavia, maintains diplomatic relations with many countries but is not widely universally acknowledged due to its status under the United Nations Security Council Resolution (Resolution ES-124).  
 In addition, there are territories within Switzerland such as Geneva and Zurich that hold regional competencies for cultural preservation.  Furthermore, Vatican City serves a significant role in global religious affairs despite not being universally recognized by many nations; coexisting with the same facts above alongside it’s own unique case of France & Spain sharing capital city (Andorra).

The task here is to create an extensive list covering all these aspects, including those territories that have multiple capitals and are shared between countries. The details must be accurate for each country within their respective national context without mixing up the facts or oversimplifying them into one singular entity's narrative as it undermines individuality of nations which is vital in understanding cultural identity across Europe, a key factor that contributes to maintaining regional traditions and practices.
 Hint: Consider Andorra la vella for unique case where France & Spain share capital city (Andorra), Geneva's role within Switzerland along with its relationship towards Vatican City which plays significant cultural relevance despite not being universally recognized as sovereign entity, Kosovo declaring independence from Yugoslavia and maintaining diplomatic relations without international recognition due to the United Nations Security Council Resolution (Resolution ES-124), Sweden's unique decentralization policy with municipalities sharing regional competencies.
Write a detailed essay on how these multiple capitals, shared responsibilities of cities across nations like Andorra and Switzerland have shaped their cultural identities while maintaining individuality as Europe’s diverse nation-states? Your response must thoroughly cover each country mentioned above without mixing them up or simplifying facts. Consider the complex dynamics between countries sharing a capital city (Andorra), regional competencies within nations like Sweden, Kosovo's unique position with limited international recognition while maintaining its own cultural resilience and identity despite recent turmoimy as well Switzerland’s relationship towards Vatican City in your essay.
