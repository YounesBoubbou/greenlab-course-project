The Industrial Revolution set into motion unprecedented levels of greenhouse gas emissions due primarily to coal-powered factories and extensive use of fossil fuels, thereby significantly influencing global temperatures—a phenomenon we recognize today as climate change. The Kyoto Protocol (1997) was an early response aiming for nationally determined targets on carbon dioxide emission reductions; however, its impact has been mixed due to disparities in commitments among nations and the absence of participation from key emitters like China until later agreements were established.

The Paris Agreement (2015) marked a more inclusive approach where nearly every nation committed voluntarily within their capacities towards limiting global temperature rise, with an aim to keep it below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts for even lower targets. Financial mechanisms were introduced such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which assists developing countries in adaptation projects where funds are mobilized from developed nations—a clear sign of collective responsibility towards environmental sustainability despite economic differences among participating states.

Parallel to these international agreements, substantial progress has been made economically and technologically as societies adapt their industries for a greener future. Investment in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectricity—and advancements like higher efficiency photovoltaic cells or offshore turbine technology have become more feasible with decreased costs due to economies of scale and innovation encouraged by government subsidies where available.

Additionally, electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly becoming a mainstream option for consumers as battery technologies improve in performance—reducing range anxiety issues that once limited adoption rates alongside growing infrastructure like charging stations spread around the globe with supportive policies and economic stimulus packages. The shift towards 'green' building practices, including energy efficiency standards, is also reshaping construction norms while promoting sustainability in urban planning to reduce carbon footprint from residential buildings—a sector often overlooked when considering emissions sources.

Furthermore, breakthrough technologies like Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are being integrated into industrial processes with potential for significant impact; though implementation remains limited due to high costs or regulatory challenges in some regions. The agricultural sector is adopting more sustainable practices such as precision farming that reduce emissions while increasing productivity, supported by financial instruments and knowledge transfer from developed countries under mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

The intersection of climate action with economic opportunities—such as job creation in renewables sector or through green innovation hubs—signifies a broader recognition that environmental stewardship can go hand-in-hand with progress. International collaboration and domestic policy reforms continue to play pivotal roles, underpinning the global effort required for sustainable economic growth aligned with climate goals set forth by agreements like Paris Summit's COP21—where future targets are regularly revisited in light of advancing technology and evolving socioepective understandings.

In sum, while challenges remain vast following centuries-long industrialization patterns that contribute to emissions, the response is multifaceted: combining international agreements with economic stimuli directed at innovation, infrastructure development for alternative energies (and electric vehicles), and sustainable building practices—all underpinned by a global push towards mitigating climate change impacts. The journey toward environmental rehabilitation continues as societies leverage technology not just to curb emissions but also foster new industries at the forefront of this historic transformation, demonstrating that economic and technological progress can align with—and even benefit from—environmental imperatives in a post-industrial world.
