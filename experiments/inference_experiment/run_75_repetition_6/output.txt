## Primary Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Across Industries

**Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**

* **Power generation:** 40% of global emissions – coal-fired power plants being major contributors.
* **Transportation:** 24% of emissions – vehicles using fossil fuels for fuel.
* **Industrial processes:** 17% of emissions – manufacturing and production processes relying on fossil fuels.
* **Residential and commercial buildings:** 14% of emissions – energy use for heating, cooling, and lighting.


**Methane (CH4)**

* **Agriculture:** 37% of emissions – livestock digestion and manure management.
* **Waste management:** 20% of emissions – anaerobic decomposition of organic materials in landfills.
* **Energy production:** 17% of emissions – natural gas leaks and incomplete combustion.

**Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**

* **Agriculture:** 65% of emissions – soil management practices and animal waste.
* **Chemical manufacturing:** 18% of emissions – production of fertilizers and other chemicals.

**Variations Across Industries:**

* **High-emitting industries:** Power generation, transportation, and industrial processes contribute significantly to overall CO2 emissions.
* **Agriculture:** Major source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions.
* **Waste management:** Significant methane emissions, particularly from landfills.
* **Chemical manufacturing:** Major nitrous oxide emitter.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Emissions vary geographically, with developing countries experiencing rapid increases in emissions due to industrialization.
* Technological advancements and policy interventions can influence emission reduction across industries.
* Carbon capture and storage technologies are potential solutions for high-emitting industries.
