Key insights from this paper highlight AI's integration into various sectors such as web search engines (Google), recommendation systems on platforms like YouTube, Amazon, Netflix; voice assistants including Siri and Alexa. Autonomous vehicles by Waymo showcase the application of sophisticated machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios. While some AI applications are widely recognized—like ChatGPT for creative tasks or advanced search engines like Google Search, others blend so seamlessly into daily use that they escape categorization as 'AI.' Traditional goals such as reasoning and natural language processing have been addressed by the field's diverse methods spanning mathematics to economics. The AI discipline began in 1956 but experienced ups and downs with funding until a resurgence fueled by deep learning breakthroughs post-2012, escalating further after adopting transformer architecture technologies through the early 2020s—this era of rapid growth attracted massive investments. However, this exponential rise in AI use brought to light several unintended consequences and risks such as ethical dilemm0ns around surveillance or biases embedded within algorithms; thus sparking calls for thoughtful regulatory policies while leveraging its benefits responsibly without stifling innovation.
