The adoption of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, has significantly contributed to climate change mitigation. Technological advancements and decreasing costs have fueled this growth. However, the intermittency of these power sources requires development of energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Incentives from policymakers, along with a holistic approach encompassing energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and international cooperation, are crucial for achieving carbon neutrality.
