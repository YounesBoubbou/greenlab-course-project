Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor due to fossil fuel combustion. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), CO2 emissions account for approximately 65% of total greenhouse gas emissions.

The primary sources of CO2 emissions vary across different industries:

1. **Energy sector**: The energy sector is the largest source of CO2 emissions, accounting for around 35%. This includes power generation from fossil fuels, industrial processes, and transportation.
2. **Industry**: Industrial processes, such as cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical processing, account for around 15% of total CO2 emissions.
3. **Agriculture**: Agricultural activities, including livestock production and rice cultivation, contribute around 10% to CO2 emissions.
4. **Transportation**: The transportation sector, encompassing road, air, and sea travel, is responsible for around 5% of CO2 emissions.

Other significant greenhouse gas emitters include:

1. **Methane (CH4)**: Agriculture and natural gas systems are the primary sources of methane emissions, accounting for around 30%.
2. **Nitrous oxide (N2O)**: Agricultural activities and industrial processes contribute to nitrous oxide emissions, accounting for around 20%.

Understanding the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies and reducing global carbon footprint.
