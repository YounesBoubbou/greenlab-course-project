The primary sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions include energy production and consumption, transportation, industry, agriculture, and land use changes. Fossil fuel combustion is a major contributor to GHG emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which accounts for approximately 65% of human-induced GHG emissions.

**Energy Production and Consumption:**

*   Electricity generation from fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas, and oil
*   Industrial processes that rely on fossil fuel-based energy sources

**Transportation:**

*   Emissions from burning fossil fuels in vehicles, including cars, trucks, airplanes, and ships

**Industry:**

*   Cement production, which releases large amounts of CO2 during the manufacturing process
*   Steel production, which also emits significant quantities of GHGs

**Agriculture:**

*   Livestock farming, particularly beef and lamb production, due to methane emissions from animal digestion
*   Rice cultivation and other crops that release nitrous oxide as a byproduct of nitrogen-based fertilizers
