The provided technical paper discusses the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), its evolution, and its various applications. AI is defined as intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems, which enables them to perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. The paper highlights the traditional goals of AI research, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. It also notes the long-term goal of general intelligence, which is the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. The paper mentions the founding of AI as an academic discipline in 1956 and its subsequent cycles of optimism and disappointment, including the current AI boom.
