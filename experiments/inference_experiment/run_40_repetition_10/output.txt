The adoption of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, has grown due to technological advancements and lowered costs. However, their intermittent nature requires energy storage solutions and grid integration strategies. Incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs support the transition. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and international cooperation.
