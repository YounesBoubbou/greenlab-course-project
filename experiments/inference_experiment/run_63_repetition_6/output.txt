Climate change is largely attributed to anthropogenic activities that increase greenhouse gas concentrations, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat in the atmosphere through a natural process called the greenhouse effect. Human-induced emissions of these gases have significantly enhanced this warming since preindustrial times, primarily due to fossil fuel combustion for energy production.

CO2 is mainly released from burning coal, oil, and gas for electricity generation, transportation (from vehicles), industrial processes, deforestation when trees that would otherwise absorb CO2 are cut down, and other activities such as agriculture and landfills. Approximately 76% of global anthropogenic emissions come from energy-related sources like power plants and motor vehicles which account for the largest share in industries including transportation (34%) and electricity generation (21%).

Methane, although present in smaller quantities than CO2 in the atmosphere at 8%, is over 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas per unit mass. Its main sources include agriculture – particularly livestock such as cows which produce significant amounts of methane through enteric fermentation and manure management, landfills where organic waste decomposes anaerobically releasing CH4, oil and natural gas industries with leaks during extraction and transportation processes. Moreover, rice cultivation is a notable source as well due to the flooded fields which promote methane-producing bacteria activity in waterlogged soils under low oxygen conditions.

Nitrous oxide emissions account for around 6% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas contributions and are approximately 300 times more potent than CO2 on a molecule by molecule basis over a century timeframe. The primary source is agriculture, especially from nitrogen-based fertilizers used in farming that stimulate microbial processes leading to N2O emissions when applied or left as ammonia (NH3). Livestock urine and manures also contribute significantly due to the decomposition of organic matter.

While energy production is a significant contributor for CO2, agriculture holds substantial roles in methane and nitrous oxide emissions across various industries – with transportation being another notable source particularly from road vehicles like cars that emit carbon dioxide as they burn gasoline or diesel. Efforts to mitigate climate change thus require global cooperation, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the transition towards renewable energy sources and sustainable agricultural practices across different sectors of society.
