The provided technical paper highlights artificial intelligence (AI) as an interdisciplinary field aimed at developing machines that can perform tasks traditionally requiring human intellect, such as learning from experience or interacting via natural language. AI's applications range widely, including advanced web search engines like Google Search and recommendation systems on platforms like YouTube and Netflix to sophisticated technology in autonomous vehicles (Waymo) and generative tools for art creation—all of which are embedded within various subfields such as reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, natural language processing, perception, robotics support. General AI's ultimate goal is human-level intelligence across tasks; however, achieving this has seen a cyclical journey through funding highs and lows since its inception around 1956.

Deep Learning marked significant progress for the field after 2012 with substantial investments increasing exponentially by early 2020 (AI boom), leveraging advanced techniques like transformer architecture to push boundaries further into practical applications and creative outputs such as AI art generation tools, including ChatGPT. Yet along this progressive journey comes the recognition of risks—unintended consequences ranging from societal impacts on employment due to automation, through biases inherent in algorithmic decision-making processes (e.g., facial and voice recognition), leading up to a contemporary discourse around regulatory measures aimed at balancing innovation's benefits against potential long-term detriments—reflecting the field’s growing societal impact beyond mere technology development into ethical considerations, economic implications, governance issues.
