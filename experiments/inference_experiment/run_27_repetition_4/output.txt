 Climate change is a global issue driven primarily by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere. The most significant contributor to this problem is carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up about 76% of total GHG emissions. The primary sources of CO2 emissions are mainly attributable to human activities, particularly those related to energy production and transportation.

Fossil fuel combustion is the largest single source of CO2 emissions, accounting for approximately two-thirds (64%) of global greenhouse gas emissions. In the power sector, coal is the largest contributor to CO2 emissions due to its extensive use in electricity generation. The transportation sector, particularly road transport, is another significant emitter of CO2, primarily from the burning of gasoline and diesel fuel in cars and trucks.

Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are other potent greenhouse gases, with methane being about 25 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2 over a 100-year timeframe. The primary sources of methane emissions include agriculture (mainly from livestock and rice cultivation), landfills, and the production and transport of natural gas. Nitrous oxide is primarily emitted through agricultural practices, such as the use of nitrogen fertilizers and manure management.

The distribution of greenhouse gas emissions across different industries varies significantly. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the energy sector accounted for about 63% of global CO2 emissions in 2019, followed by industry at 22%, transportation at 15%, and agriculture, forestry, and other land use at 14%. These percentages are subject to change based on regional differences and economic development.

In conclusion, greenhouse gas emissions primarily come from fossil fuel combustion, with carbon dioxide being the most significant contributor. Methane and nitrous oxide also play substantial roles in driving climate change. The primary sources of these emissions vary across industries, with the energy sector being the largest emitter of CO2. Understanding these sources is essential to developing effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change.
