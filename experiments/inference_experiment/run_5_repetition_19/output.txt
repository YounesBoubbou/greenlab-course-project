The paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of AI research is to achieve general intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. To reach this goal, AI researchers have adapted and integrated techniques from search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The paper also discusses the history of AI, including multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment known as AI winters, and the current growth in funding and interest in the field, leading to concerns about the risks and long-term effects of AI.
