 Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), human activities are responsible for a 76% increase in CO2 emissions since 1970, and 64% of this total comes from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity, heat, and transportation.
Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are other potent greenhouse gases that contribute significantly to climate change. Methane is the second most abundant GHG, with human activities accounting for approximately 60% of total methane emissions. The primary sources of methane emissions include agriculture (40%), fossil fuel production and processing (27%), and waste management (18%). In agriculture, livestock farming is the largest contributor to methane emissions due to enteric fermentation in ruminants and manure management practices.
Nitrous oxide is the third most significant greenhouse gas, with human activities accounting for approximately 65% of total N2O emissions. The primary sources of nitrous oxide emissions include agriculture (71%) and industrial processes such as the production of adipic acid, caprolactam, and nitric and nitrogenous fertilizers. In agriculture, nitrous oxide is produced through microbial denitrification in soil and through the application of nitrogen fertilizers.
The energy sector, particularly fossil fuel combustion for electricity, heat, and transportation, is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions across all industries. However, the proportionate contribution of different sectors varies. For instance, agriculture accounts for a larger percentage of methane emissions compared to other sectors, while industrial processes contribute significantly to nitrous oxide emissions. Understanding these sector-specific emission sources and trends is crucial for developing effective climate change mitigation strategies.
