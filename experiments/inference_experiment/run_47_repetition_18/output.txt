Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses computer systems that mimic human intelligence through perception, learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, and robotics. AI applications range from web searches to recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and superhuman game play. While some advanced AI is indistinguishable to users, many cutting-edge technologies have become so integrated into daily life they are not labeled as AI. AI research aims to achieve general intelligence equivalent to human level in various tasks such as reasoning, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics.

The history of AI began as an academic discipline in 1956 but experienced several cycles of optimism followed by disappointment (AI winters) due to unsolved challenges and overhyped promises. However, from the mid-2010s with breakthroughs like deep learning and the transformer architecture, AI saw a dramatic surge in funding and interest leading to unprecedented investment ($100 billion+ per year as of early 2020s). The widespread adoption has brought about unforeseen consequences, harms, and ethical concerns which have sparked discussions on regulatory policies for AI safety and benefits.
