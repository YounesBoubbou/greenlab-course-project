The paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The field's long-term goal is to achieve general intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. To reach this goal, AI researchers have adapted and integrated techniques from various fields such as search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The paper also discusses the history of AI, including its founding in 1956 and multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment known as AI winters. The recent growth of AI, fueled by deep learning and the transformer architecture, has led to increased funding and investment but has also raised concerns about unintended consequences and harms in the present and future.
