Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses systems that exhibit intelligence by perceiving their environment and using learning to achieve goals. Key applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and game playing. AI subfields focus on reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. It has evolved from academic founding in 1956 through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment. Recent breakthroughs with deep learning (post-2012) and transformer architectures (post-2017) have fueled an AI boom, driving substantial investment. However, widespread use also exposes unintended consequences and risks, prompting discussions on regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
