 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer science field developing methods for machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve goals. Applications include search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and strategy games. AI research includes subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, robotics, and general intelligence. Techniques used include search, logic, neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI was founded in 1956 and went through cycles of optimism and disappointment, with renewed interest since the 2010s due to deep learning and transformer architecture advancements. Widespread use has exposed unintended consequences and raised concerns about risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions on regulatory policies.
