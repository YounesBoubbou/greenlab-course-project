The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), which is a field of computer science that focuses on developing methods and software to enable machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions. AI has numerous high-profile applications, including web search engines, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. However, many everyday technologies are also using AI without being labeled as such. There are various subfields of AI research, each with specific goals and tools, such as reasoning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. General intelligence is a long-term goal, which requires adapting and integrating a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics and operations research. AI has gone through multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment, but the field has experienced significant growth since 2012 with the development of deep learning and the transformer architecture. This growth has led to hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, known as the AI boom. However, the widespread use of AI in the 21st century has exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
