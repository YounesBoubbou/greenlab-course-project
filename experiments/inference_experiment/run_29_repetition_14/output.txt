 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer science field that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve goals. Applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools. AI research aims for general intelligence. Techniques used include search, logic, neural networks, statistics, and integration of psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. Founded in 1956, AI has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, experiencing significant growth since 2012 with deep learning and transformer architecture. Widespread use of AI raised concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and future effects, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
