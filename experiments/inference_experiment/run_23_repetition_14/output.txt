The technical paper provides a broad overview of artificial intelligence (AI), including its definition, history, and applications. AI is a field of research in computer science that aims to develop and study methods and software that enable machines to learn and perceive their environment to achieve specific goals. The traditional goals of AI include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. However, many AI applications are not recognized as such, having become commonplace without the "AI" label. Techniques from various fields, including search, mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics, have been adapted and integrated to reach these goals. The field has experienced multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. However, recent advancements in deep learning and the transformer architecture have led to increased funding and interest, referred to as the AI boom. The widespread use of AI has exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
