Greenhouse gas emissions stem from various human activities, varying significantly across industries:

**Fossil Fuel Combustion:** This is the dominant source, responsible for ~75% of global CO₂ emissions.  

* **Electricity & Heat Production:** Burning coal, oil, and natural gas in power plants to generate electricity is a major contributor. 
* **Transportation:** Cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes fueled by gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel release substantial amounts of CO₂.
* **Industry:** Manufacturing processes often rely on fossil fuels for energy, generating emissions from steel production, cement manufacturing, and chemical processing.

**Agriculture & Land Use:** These sectors account for ~24% of global emissions:

* **Livestock:** Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is released during digestion by cattle, sheep, and goats.
* **Rice Cultivation:** Flooding rice paddies produces methane emissions.
* **Deforestation:** Trees absorb CO₂, so deforestation releases stored carbon and reduces the planet's capacity to absorb future emissions.

**Other Sources:** 

* **Waste Management:** Decomposition in landfills generates methane.
* **Industrial Processes:** Certain chemical processes release fluorinated gases, which have a high global warming potential.


Addressing climate change requires reducing emissions across all sectors through transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, adopting sustainable agricultural practices, and promoting responsible land use.
