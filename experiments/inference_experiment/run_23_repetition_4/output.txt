The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of research that develops methods and software for machines to perceive their environment, learn, and make decisions. AI has many practical applications, including search engines, recommendation systems, human speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and superhuman play in strategy games. However, some cutting-edge AI is not recognized as such because it becomes so commonplace that it's no longer labeled AI. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics, with general intelligence being a long-term goal. Researchers use various techniques, including search and optimization algorithms, neural networks, and methods based on statistics and operations research to achieve these goals. AI has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winter, but funding and interest have increased after the success of deep learning and transformer architecture. The paper also highlights the unintended consequences and risks associated with AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
