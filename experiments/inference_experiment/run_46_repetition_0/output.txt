The adoption of renewables combats climate change; solar and wind power growth advances due to tech improvements and cost reductions. Intermittency challenges energy systems necessitating storage solutions and grid integration strategies. Policymakers offer incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs for transition acceleration. A holistic approach, including energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and global cooperation, is essential for carbon neutrality.
