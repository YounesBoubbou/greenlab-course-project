Artificial intelligence (AI) involves developing computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, learning, and natural language processing. Key applications include search engines, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools. AI research focuses on subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, and natural language processing with techniques including search optimization, neural networks, and statistics. Founded in 1956, the field experienced periods of optimism and funding followed by winters; it saw significant growth after 2012 due to deep learning and especially since 2017 with transformer architectures. However, widespread use has exposed unintended consequences, raising concerns about safety, regulation, and long-term risks.
