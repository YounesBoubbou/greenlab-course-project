The Industrial Revolution's legacy on greenhouse gas emissions has led to a global effort to mitigate its effects. In recent years, significant economic and technological advancements have emerged in response to climate change. One notable development is the growth of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewables accounted for 26% of global electricity generation in 2020, up from 21% in 2015 (IEA, 2021). This shift has been driven by declining costs, government incentives, and increased investment in clean energy technologies.

Another key advancement is the rise of electric vehicles (EVs). As governments set ambitious targets for reducing emissions, EVs have become increasingly popular. In 2020, over 2 million EVs were sold worldwide, a significant increase from just 40,000 in 2011 (International Council on Clean Transportation, 2021). This trend is expected to continue as battery costs decrease and charging infrastructure expands.

In addition to these technological advancements, the green economy has also seen significant growth. The Global Green Economy Index (GGEI) reports that over $1 trillion was invested in clean energy projects between 2015 and 2019, creating millions of jobs worldwide (GGEI, 2020). This trend is expected to continue as governments prioritize sustainability and innovation.

Furthermore, innovative technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), green hydrogen, and advanced biofuels are being developed to support a low-carbon economy. For instance, the IEA estimates that CCS could reduce emissions by up to 10 gigatons annually by 2050 (IEA, 2021). These advancements demonstrate the significant progress made in responding to climate change, highlighting the critical role of economic and technological innovation in addressing this pressing global issue.
