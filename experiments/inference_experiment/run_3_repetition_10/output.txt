Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor. The primary sources of GHG emissions can be broadly categorized into three sectors: energy production, transportation, and industrial processes.

Energy production is the largest source of GHG emissions, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation, heating, and transportation. In 2020, the energy sector accounted for about 65% of global CO2 emissions, with coal-fired power plants being the largest contributor.

Transportation is the second-largest source of GHG emissions, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles. In 2020, transportation accounted for about 15% of global CO2 emissions, with cars and trucks being the largest contributors.

Industrial processes, such as cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical synthesis, also emit significant amounts of GHGs. These industrial processes accounted for about 10% of global CO2 emissions in 2020.

The contribution of different industries to GHG emissions varies significantly. For example, the energy sector is the largest contributor to GHG emissions globally, while the transportation sector is the second-largest contributor. Within the transportation sector, cars and light trucks are the largest contributors to GHG emissions, while air travel and shipping contribute significantly as well. In terms of industrial processes, the cement industry is the largest contributor to GHG emissions, followed by the steel industry and chemical synthesis.

To mitigate climate change, it is essential to reduce emissions from these primary sources. This can be achieved through a variety of measures, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and implementing carbon capture and storage technologies in industrial processes.
