The Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in human society, including the rise of capitalism, urbanization, and technological advancements. However, this era also marked a turning point for the environment, as the increased use of fossil fuels and industrial processes led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. This has contributed to global warming and other environmental issues, such as air pollution and deforestation.
In response to these challenges, various international efforts have been made to address climate change. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5% from 1990 levels. It set targets for countries to reduce their emissions and established mechanisms for monitoring and reporting progress.
However, the Kyoto Protocol has faced criticism for being too lenient on developed countries and not doing enough to reduce emissions in developing countries. This led to the Paris Agreement, which was adopted in 2015 and entered into force in 2016. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to pursue the effort limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius.
In addition to international agreements, technological advancements have also emerged as part of the response to climate change. For example, renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power have become increasingly popular as an alternative to fossil fuels. These technologies are not only environmentally friendly but also economically viable, with costs continuing to decrease over time.
Furthermore, the development of electric vehicles has gained significant traction in recent years, as they produce fewer emissions than traditional gasoline or diesel-powered cars. Governments around the world have implemented policies to promote the use of electric vehicles, including tax incentives and subsidies for manufacturers.
In conclusion, while the Industrial Revolution brought about significant economic and technological advancements, it also had a profound impact on the environment. In response to these challenges, international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement have been implemented to address climate change. Additionally, technological advancements such as renewable energy and electric vehicles have emerged as part of the response to this global issue.
