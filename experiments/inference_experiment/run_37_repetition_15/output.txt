The response to climate change has not only seen significant technological advancements but also marked shifts in economic strategies. Here's a comprehensive summary:

1. Technological Breakthroughs:
- Renewable Energy: Solar, wind, and hydro power have experienced massive growth, making them competitive with fossil fuels.
- Energy Storage: Battery technology, particularly for electric vehicles (EVs) and home storage systems, has advanced significantly, reducing the reliance on grid electricity.
- Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): While still in development, CCS technologies aim to capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other sources, preventing their release into the atmosphere.

2. Economic Adaptations:
- Decarbonization: Governments and businesses have shifted investments towards low-carbon sectors, such as green infrastructure, EVs, and renewable energy.
- Green Jobs: The transition towards a low-carbon economy has led to the creation of new jobs in industries like renewable energy, energy storage, and environmental management.
- Carbon Pricing: Governments have implemented carbon pricing mechanisms, such as taxes on fossil fuels or cap-and-trade systems, to incentivize emissions reduction.

In conclusion, the response to climate change has been marked by significant technological advancements and strategic economic adaptations. These efforts are crucial in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and building a sustainable future for humanity.
