The provided technical paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science. AI enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. The paper highlights various applications of AI, including search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools. It also discusses the traditional goals of AI research, such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, and perception. To achieve these goals, researchers have adapted techniques from fields like mathematics, logic, neural networks, statistics, and economics. The paper notes that AI has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, but recent advances in deep learning and transformer architecture have led to significant investment and growth. However, the widespread use of AI has also raised concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and long-term effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies for its safe and beneficial use.
