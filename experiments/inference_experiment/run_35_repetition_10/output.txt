 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer science field that enables machines to perform tasks, replicating human intelligence. It encompasses various applications such as web search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools. AI subfields include reasoning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. The ultimate goal is general intelligence. Techniques used include search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, neural networks, and methods from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc. AI's history includes cycles of optimism and disappointment known as "AI winter," but funding and interest have increased significantly since 2012 due to advancements in deep learning and the transformer architecture. Widespread use of AI has raised concerns about its unintended consequences, risks, and long-term effects, prompting discussions on regulatory policies.
