The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The most significant contributor to CO2 emissions is fossil fuel combustion, primarily from the energy sector. In particular:

* Energy production and consumption account for around 60% of global CO2 emissions, with coal being the largest source.
* Industry processes, such as cement manufacturing and steel production, contribute approximately 5%.
* Agriculture, forestry, and land-use changes account for about 15%, primarily due to livestock farming, rice cultivation, and deforestation.

Methane emissions primarily originate from:

* Livestock farming (30%), particularly beef and dairy cattle.
* Natural gas and oil systems (20%).
* Agriculture, forestry, and land-use changes (15%).

Nitrous oxide emissions are mainly generated by:

* Fertilizer use in agriculture (60%).
* Industrial processes, such as cement manufacturing and steel production (20%).
* Biomass burning and agricultural activities (10%).

The varying levels of emissions across industries highlight the need for targeted mitigation strategies. For instance, improving energy efficiency and transitioning to renewable energy sources can significantly reduce CO2 emissions from the energy sector. Implementing more efficient livestock farming practices and reducing fertilizer use in agriculture can help decrease methane and nitrous oxide emissions, respectively.
