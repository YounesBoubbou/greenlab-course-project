This paper provides a broad overview of artificial intelligence (AI), encompassing its definition, applications, history, and impact.  

Key insights include:

* **AI's wide reach:** AI is integrated into many aspects of our lives, from search engines to autonomous vehicles, often without being explicitly recognized as such.
* **Subfields and goals:** AI research focuses on diverse areas like reasoning, learning, natural language processing, and ultimately aims for general intelligence comparable to humans.
* **Evolution of AI:** The field has experienced cycles of hype and disillusionment, but a resurgence driven by deep learning and transformer architectures since 2012 has led to massive investment and widespread adoption.
* **Ethical considerations:** While beneficial, AI's growing influence raises concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and the need for regulatory policies to ensure responsible development and deployment.
