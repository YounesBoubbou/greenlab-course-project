The paper provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI) research and its various subfields, goals, and techniques. It highlights the long-term goal of achieving general intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. The field has evolved through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winters, but recent advancements in deep learning have led to a significant increase in funding and interest. However, the widespread use of AI has also exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits. In summary, the paper provides a detailed understanding of AI research, its goals, techniques, and current state, as well as potential risks and future considerations.
