## Your task：In your role as a seasoned historian specializing in African geography and political science with an eye towards sustainable economic development strategies within the continent's rapidly urbanizing cities. In light of this focus on environmentally conscious infrastructure investments leading to potential shifts in population density, critically evaluate the given document through detailed research into the primary factors that have contributed to Nairobi’s growth as an attractive city for foreign direct investment (FDI), examining both historical and contemporary drivers. In your analysis, delve deeply into how this urban expansion has impacted cultural evolution within these metropolises in relation to their respective countries' GDP per capita using the CIA World Factbook data from 2019-present as a reference point for Nairobi; compare it with another African city of similar size and geographical positioning that you identify. Then, discuss how this rapid urbanization could reshape demographic patterns within the region in light of potential future developments up to Augustus's age 2050 based on current trends (including but not limited to climate change impact projections), employing specific theories from social science literature and scholarly articles that focus particularly on Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, provide a nuanced critique regarding the implications of such growth in terms of sustainability challenges for urban planning authorities while considering economic indicators such as GDP per capita (2019 to 2050) and potential environmental hazards due to increased landfill usage amidst climate change, without referencing specific figures or data from the document. In a structured essay of no more than five paragraphs that includes at least three scholarly sources in APA format with inline citations (not included here), substantiate your points while adhering strictly not to use any direct quotes but paraphrasing information and concepts for comprehension, without using the words 'infrastructure', 'development' or 'urbanization'. Instead of mentioning Nairobi directly, refer consistently as "City X".

Document: 
Nairobi is one of Africa’s most dynamic cities. With a population that has burgeoned to over five million people since the year 2014 (Wu et al., 2017), it stands at an all-time high in Kenya's economic prosperity and growth, earning itself as one of Africa’s fastest growing cities. The city is home to a diverse demographic spectrum where approximately half its population lives below the poverty line (World Bank/UNHCR data from 2019) making it a prominent hub for tourism and business opportunities that have been created by these burgeoning industries such as banking, education, real estate development in Africa's most vibrant East African city. The report on the CIA World Factbook notes Nairobi’s impressive GDP per capita (World Bank Data from 2019), underscored its growth and resilience despite being located within a nation of an annual average income rate that stands at $3,786; making it Africa's fastest growing economy. The city is also the commercial hub for Kenya’s third most populous nationality (Wang et al., 2015), further highlighted by its remarkable infrastructure developments and extensive transport system which include a robust sewage, power grids, internet connectivity networks in Africa's economic heartland. Nairobi is an attractive destination for foreign direct investors with the presence of major financial institutions like IBM World Trade Center (2016), who are drawn to its ever-growing real estate and entertainment centers such as Westlands Mall, Kilifi Country Club Hotel & Towers in Zone 4. Moreover, Nairobi's burgeoning industries have brought about a steady stream of foreign direct investments (FDI) since the mid-1980’s which has led to its economic expansion and modernization by providing over $25 billion worth of tourism services annually in 2016 alone. This essay will discuss City X's growth, sustainability plans for this vibrant city that includes investing heavily on environmental protection infrastructure projects while avoiding any direct mention or comparison to Nairobi but using the document as its inspiration and contextualize a comprehensive analysis of how these aspects have been instrumental in shaping it into becoming an alluring prospectus. However, City X has always faced challenges such as poor housing conditions for refugees (Duffy et al., 2014) while the influx of people to this urban area increases from yearly migrations and tourists have significantly increased its population which led Nairobi's local authorities to develop infrastructural improvements. The city is known internationally as a haven for businesses in Kenya, with an estimated GDP contribution between $305 billion of revenue annually (BBC News, 2016). Nevertheless, it’s urbanization rate has resulted from the rapid and continuous growth experienced since its independence. Nairobi is set to be one of Africa's fastest-growing cities by far due to several development projects that have been undertaken in recent years (Nyamweya & Satterthwaite, 2015; Gikandi and Kipiani, 2016). To further propel its growth into the future as a top city for economic expansion with unparalleled potentials.

City X - A Burgeoning African Metropolis in East Africa | Sustainability Studies at UNSW Nairobi and Economic Development 
Nairobi, City of Kenya has been selected to be one among the top two cities for investment by foreign direct capital (CNN) as well. It is strategically located near key regional markets in East Africa like Mombasa but also a gateway between Tanzania's industrial powerhouse and some of its largest industries, notably manufacturing, healthcare, tourism and agriculture; all have significantly benefited the city’s economy (Cohen et al., 2019). It is located close to Lake Victoria which contributes in an important natural resource for many Nairobians making it one of Africa's largest urban centers. However, despite its booming growth and development as well as strong local market prospects; the city still suffers from various problems like water shortages (Kimani et al., 2019). This essay will explore these cities potential for foreign direct investment based on sustainable urban planning strategies. As a result, City X has experienced an increase in FDI of about $45 billion since the city’s establishment as Africa's third largest financial hub (Nyamweya & Satterthwaite, 2016). This essay will examine how such growth impacted Nairobi and other cities with a population nearing five million. The economic prospect of this urban region has grown rapidly through the introduction of modern industries within their metropolitan spaces as well (Gikandi & Kipiani, 2014; Ngugi et al., 2self-contained instruction:
