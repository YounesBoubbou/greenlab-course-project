This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It defines AI as machine intelligence, highlighting its diverse applications across industries like search, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools.  

The paper emphasizes that AI's evolution involves continuous cycles of progress and setbacks, marked by periods of heightened funding and research (AI booms) followed by reduced interest (AI winters). 

Key advancements, such as deep learning and the transformer architecture, have fueled recent rapid growth in AI capabilities. However, the widespread adoption of AI has also raised concerns about unintended consequences and potential risks, prompting discussions on responsible development and regulation.
