 The adoption of renewable energy sources is vital for combating climate change. Solar and wind power have grown due to technological advancements and decreasing costs. However, the intermittency poses challenges that require energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers incentivize the transition with tax credits and feed-in tariffs. To achieve carbon neutrality, a holistic approach involving energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration is necessary.
