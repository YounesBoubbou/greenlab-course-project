 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that develops methods for machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. Applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and strategy games. AI research focuses on traditional goals such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. Techniques used include search, optimization, formal logic, neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI was founded in 1956 but went through cycles of optimism and disappointment. Investment increased after deep learning outperformed previous techniques in the late 2010s, leading to hundreds of billions being invested. Unintended consequences and risks have led to discussions about regulatory policies.
