The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is primarily driven by human activities that release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The primary sources of these emissions vary across different industries, but can be broadly categorized as follows:

**Carbon Dioxide (CO2):**

* Fossil fuel combustion: 65% of CO2 emissions come from burning coal, oil, and gas for energy.
	+ Electricity generation (25%)
	+ Industrial processes (20%)
	+ Transportation (15%)
	+ Buildings and homes (10%)
* Land use changes: Deforestation and land degradation account for an additional 20% of CO2 emissions.

**Methane (CH4):**

* Agriculture: Livestock digestion, manure management, and rice cultivation contribute to 30-40% of CH4 emissions.
* Natural Gas Systems: Leaks from oil and gas production, processing, and transportation account for 10-20% of CH4 emissions.

**Nitrous Oxide (N2O):**

* Agriculture: Fertilizer use in agriculture is responsible for 60-70% of N2O emissions.
* Industrial Processes: Emissions from the production of nitric acid and adipic acid, among others, account for 10-20% of N2O emissions.

The remaining industries, including transportation, buildings, and manufacturing, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding these primary sources is essential for developing effective mitigation strategies to combat climate change.
