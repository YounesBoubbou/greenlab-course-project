The paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), outlining how AI encompasses a wide range of techniques, algorithms, and tools that enable machines or computer systems to perceive their environment and take actions towards achieving predefined goals. Traditional objectives in AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing (NLP), perception, support for robotics, among others with long-term aspirations of general intelligence akin to human capabilities. The field has witnessed cycles of progress and setbacks historically known as "AI winter," but significant advancements in deep learning since 2012 have led to unprecedented investment growth into AI, terming it the 'AI boom'. Despite these gains, widespread adoption has revealed several societal and ethical issues necessitating regulatory discussions. The paper suggests that as we advance towards an era where AI becomes increasingly integrated in various applications across industries, addressing its unintended consequences is imperative to ensure it remains beneficial for society at large.
