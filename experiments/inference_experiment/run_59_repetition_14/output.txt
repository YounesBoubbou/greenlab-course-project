 Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that develops methods and software for machines to perceive their environment, learn from data, and take actions to achieve defined goals. This includes advanced web search engines like Google Search, recommendation systems used by platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, speech-based interactions with devices like Siri and Alexa, autonomous vehicles like Waymo, generative and creative tools such as ChatGPT and AI art, and the ability of some games to play at a superhuman level. Traditional goals in AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence is also a long-term goal of AI research. The field has gone through cycles of optimism, disappointment, and funding loss known as "AI winters." However, interest and investment increased significantly after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous techniques. The widespread use of AI in the 21st century has raised concerns about unintended consequences and risks associated with its long-term effects.
