The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) research, its applications, and its evolution. AI is defined as a field of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals. The subfields of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of AI research is general intelligence, which involves completing any task performable by a human on an equal level. To reach this goal, researchers have integrated various techniques from fields like mathematics, logic, statistics, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. After experiencing multiple "AI winters," the field experienced significant growth after 2012 with the emergence of deep learning and transformer architecture, leading to a massive investment in AI. However, this rapid development also raised concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and risks associated with AI, prompting discussions on regulatory policies for its safe use.
