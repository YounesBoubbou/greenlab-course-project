The adoption of renewable energy sources is crucial in combatting climate change. Technological advancements and decreasing costs have led to growth in solar and wind power. However, intermittency requires energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers incentivize transition with tax credits and feed-in tariffs, but achieving carbon neutrality needs a holistic approach including energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
