Renewable energy sources like solar and wind have seen significant growth due to technological improvements and declining costs. However, their intermittent nature requires energy storage and grid integration solutions. Policymakers incentivize transition with measures like tax credits and feed-in tariffs. Achieving carbon neutrality demands a holistic approach involving energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and international cooperation.
