 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. Applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and strategy games. AI research aims for general intelligence, using techniques like search, logic, neural networks, and statistics. Founded in 1956, AI has seen cycles of optimism and disappointment, with recent growth driven by deep learning and transformer architecture. However, the widespread use of AI also raises concerns about unintended consequences and long-term effects, leading to discussions on regulatory policies for ensuring safety and benefits.
