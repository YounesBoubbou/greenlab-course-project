Adopting renewable energy sources is crucial for combating climate change, driven by technological advancements and declining costs in solar and wind power. However, intermittency poses challenges, requiring energy storage solutions and grid integration strategies. Policymakers have implemented incentives to accelerate the transition, but a holistic approach incorporating energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration is needed for carbon neutrality.
