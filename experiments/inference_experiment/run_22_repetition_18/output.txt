Renewable energy sources, specifically solar and wind power, have seen growth due to technology advancements and decreasing costs. However, their intermittency poses a challenge for energy systems, requiring the development of energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers have implemented incentives to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Achieving carbon neutrality will require a holistic approach incorporating energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
