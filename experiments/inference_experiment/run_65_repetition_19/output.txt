Artificial Intelligence (AI) research aims at creating systems that can perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence for goal-oriented tasks, encompassing traditional goals like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. Deep learning techniques have catalyzed the AI boom since 2017 by pushing past prior limitations with transformer architectures leading to breakthroughs across various applications such as advanced web search engines, recommendation systems for streaming services like Netflix, intelligent personal assistants (Google Assistant), autonomous vehicles like Waymo's offerings, generative and creative tools exemplified by ChatGPT, and superhuman play in strategy games. AI's integration into everyday applications often goes unnoticed as the technology becomes ubiquitous; however, it has brought forward concerns regarding safety, ethics, societal impact, regulatory policies, transparency issues, data misuse risk (deepfakes), and potential long-term risks. The evolution of AI from its academic inception to becoming a vital yet complex facet of modern technology underscores both the monumental strides made by researchers as well as significant challenges ahead that require global attention for safe, beneficial future developments.
