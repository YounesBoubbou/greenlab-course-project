 The paper discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI), a computer science field developing systems to perceive and learn from their environment. High-profile applications include search engines, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and superhuman strategy game performance. AI's traditional goals are reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term aim is general intelligence. AI adapts various techniques like search, formal logic, neural networks, and statistics. AI's history includes periods of optimism (AI summer) and disappointment (AI winter), with recent growth due to advancements in deep learning and transformer architectures. Concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and future effects have led to discussions on regulatory policies. The widespread use of AI in the 21st century underscores its potential benefits and challenges.
