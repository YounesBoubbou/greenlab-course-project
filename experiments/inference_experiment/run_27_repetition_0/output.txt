 Climate change is primarily driven by the increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), CO2 accounts for about 76% of total GHG emissions from human activities. The primary sources of these emissions can be categorized into several industries, including:

1. Energy sector: The energy sector is the largest contributor to global CO2 emissions, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the total emissions. Coal combustion in power generation is the largest single source of CO2 emissions from this sector. Natural gas and oil production and use also contribute substantial amounts of CO2. Methane and nitrous oxide are also emitted during coal mining, natural gas production, and biomass burning.
2. Industrial processes: Industrial processes such as cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical production account for around 24% of global GHG emissions. These industries emit large amounts of CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. For example, cement production releases CO2 during the calcination of limestone, while steel manufacturing produces CO2 during the blast furnace process.
3. Agriculture: The agricultural sector is responsible for around 14% of global GHG emissions. Agricultural activities such as livestock production, rice cultivation, and fertilizer application release significant amounts of methane, nitrous oxide, and CO2. Livestock farming is the largest source of methane emissions, while rice cultivation accounts for around 10% of global methane emissions. Nitrous oxide is primarily emitted during the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers.
4. Transportation: The transportation sector accounts for around 23% of global GHG emissions. Road transport is the largest contributor to these emissions, with cars and trucks being the primary sources. Aviation and shipping also contribute significant amounts of CO2 and other GHGs due to their high fuel consumption and long distances traveled.
5. Residential and commercial: The residential and commercial sectors account for around 19% of global GHG emissions. These sectors emit large amounts of CO2 from heating, cooling, and cooking applications. Methane and nitrous oxide are also emitted during the production and disposal of waste.

Overall, the primary sources of GHG emissions vary significantly across different industries. Understanding these sources is essential to developing effective strategies for reducing global GHG emissions and mitigating climate change.
