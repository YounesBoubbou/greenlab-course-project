Climate change is largely attributed to human activities that increase greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide emissions dominate due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production - a key sector driving climate impact globally. Residential heating and transportation sectors are also significant sources of CO2. Methane (CH4), another potent GHG with about 80 times the warming potential per mass than that of carbon dioxide over a short period, is mainly produced by livestock digestion systems in agriculture, rice cultivation and decomposition practices. It also emanates from natural sources such as wetlands but has been amplified due to human activities like coal mining and the extraction industries (i.e., oil drilling).

Nitrous oxide (N2O), though less abundant, is another crucial GHG with a warming potential approximately 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide over an extended period of time and largely results from agricultural practices such as the use of synthetic fertilizers.

The energy sector stands out as the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for about two-thirds of CO2 release in 2016 due mainly to burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat production worldwide. Transportation follows closely after with petroleum products being primarily used - both cars and planes emit significant quantities of carbon dioxide through the combustion process. The agriculture sector contributes about one-quarter, largely from enteric fermentation in livestock but also emissions associated with rice cultivation, fertilizer use, burning biomass and manure management activities - primarily methane production. Lastly, industrial processes contribute a significant proportion of the other GHGs like nitrous oxide to climate change through chemical reactions that release these gases into the atmosphere during manufacturing or waste treatment procedures, while also contributing CO2 emissions from energy use in industries and deforestation impacting land-use changes.

The disparity across sectors is primarily due to differing GHG production pathways linked with each industryâ€™s nature of activity - the direct emission during combustion for fossil fuel intensive activities like electricity generation, transport or industrial processes versus indirect releases via agricultural practices and waste management methods. Therefore, reducing emissions from these primary sources is a prerequisite in mitigating climate change effects effectively.
