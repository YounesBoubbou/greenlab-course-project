## Primary Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions:

**Carbon Dioxide:**

* **Energy production:** Power plants and industrial facilities using fossil fuels.
* **Transportation:** Vehicles burning gasoline or diesel fuel.
* **Industrial processes:** Manufacturing and production activities utilizing fossil fuels.
* **Agriculture:** Livestock digestion and fossil fuel use in agricultural practices.

**Methane:**

* **Agriculture:** Livestock digestion and manure management.
* **Waste management:** Decomposition of organic waste in landfills.
* **Energy production:** Natural gas leaks and coal mining.

**Nitrous Oxide:**

* **Agriculture:** Soil management practices and livestock waste.
* **Waste management:** Decomposition of organic waste in landfills.
* **Transportation:** Emissions from vehicles with catalytic converters.


**Variations Across Industries:**

**Energy Production:**
* High emissions from coal-fired power plants.
* Emissions reduction in renewable energy deployment.

**Transportation:**
* Varying emissions depending on fuel type (gasoline vs. electric).
* Emissions reduction through fuel efficiency improvements and shift to electric vehicles.

**Manufacturing:**
* Emissions from process-related activities and energy generation.
* Variation in emissions based on production processes and fuel sources.

**Agriculture:**
* Emissions primarily from livestock and agricultural practices.
* Mitigation potential through dietary changes and improved manure management.

**Waste Management:**
* Emissions depend on the composition of waste and the efficiency of landfill management.
* Potential for reduction through waste reduction and methane capture and destruction systems.
