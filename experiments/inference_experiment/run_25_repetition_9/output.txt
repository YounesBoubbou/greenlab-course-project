 The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century and lasted through the 19th century, brought about unprecedented economic growth and technological progress. However, it also marked the beginning of a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for industrial processes and transportation. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global CO2 emissions have grown from about 1 gigaton per year in 1850 to over 36 gigatons per year in 2019, leading to a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and contributing to global warming and climate change.

In response to this challenge, the international community has taken various steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. One of the earliest efforts was the Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The protocol set binding emission reduction targets for developed countries, representing about 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions at that time. Although the protocol had some success in reducing emissions in some countries, it did not include major emitters like China and India, making it an unequal burden on developed countries.

Following the Kyoto Protocol, there have been other significant international efforts to address climate change, such as the Paris Agreement (2015). This agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement is more inclusive than the Kyoto Protocol, with all countries committing to setting targets for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.

In terms of economic advancements, the response to climate change has led to the growth of various industries focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage. For instance, solar photovoltaic technology has seen significant growth in recent years, with the cost of solar panels decreasing by about 80% since 2010. According to the International Energy Agency, renewables accounted for over 90% of new power capacity additions worldwide in 2019.

Technological advancements have also played a crucial role in addressing climate change. For example, improvements in energy efficiency have led to significant reductions in emissions from industries and buildings. Innovations like electric vehicles and advanced batteries have made transportation more sustainable. Additionally, carbon capture and storage technology has the potential to reduce emissions from power plants and industrial processes.

In conclusion, the Industrial Revolution brought about significant economic growth and technological progress but also resulted in rising greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. In response to this challenge, various international efforts have been made over the years to reduce emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. These initiatives have led to the growth of new industries focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage. Technological advancements in these areas have played a crucial role in making progress towards a low-carbon future.
