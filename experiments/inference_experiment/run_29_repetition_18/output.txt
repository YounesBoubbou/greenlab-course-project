 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment and take actions based on learning and intelligence. Applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools. AI research aims for general intelligence, utilizing techniques such as optimization, logic, neural networks, and statistics. Founded in 1956, AI experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment, with recent growth due to deep learning and transformer architectures. Widespread use has exposed unintended consequences and raised concerns about safety and future impacts, leading to regulatory discussions.
