 Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have become increasingly popular due to their environmental benefits and decreasing costs. However, their intermittent nature requires advanced storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Governments have provided incentives to promote the adoption of renewable energy, but achieving carbon neutrality will require a comprehensive approach that includes energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
