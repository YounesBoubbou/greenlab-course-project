The technical paper discusses the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its various subfields. AI is defined as intelligence exhibited by machines that enables them to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, researchers have adapted a wide range of techniques from various fields, including mathematics, statistics, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The field has experienced multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, but funding and interest have vastly increased since 2012 with the advent of deep learning. Today, hundreds of billions of dollars are being invested in AI, exposing unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
