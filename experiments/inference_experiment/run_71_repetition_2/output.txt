The technical paper highlights artificial intelligence (AI) as a multifaceted field aimed at creating machines capable of environmental perception, learning, intelligent action towards goal achievement—essentially emulating human-like reasoning. AI's applications are vast and deeply integrated into daily life via search engines like Google, recommendation systems for platforms such as YouTube or Amazon Prime Video, voice assistants including Siri/Alexa, autonomous driving (Waymo), creative software tools exemplified by ChatGPT, AlphaGo, etc., which all utilize AI techniques. Despite its extensive use and pervasive impact across numerous domains—from entertainment to transportation and beyond—the paper underscores that many of these applications are not explicitly categorized as 'AI'. The traditional goals in the quest for general intelligence have included reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning capabilities along with natural language processing (NLP) and robotics support.

The evolutionary trajectory witnessed various highs and lows—known as AI winter periods due to funding cutback—ultimately culminating in a significant renaissance following the deep-learning breakthrough around 2012, leading to increased investments (the 'AI boom'). The current widespread application of AI has brought about unintended consequences and ethical concerns. These range from privacy issues with data collection for algorithm training to biases in machine learning systems that propagate discrimination or unfair outcomes, prompting urgent conversations around regulation and policy-making focused on mitigating the potential risks while maximizing AI's benefits responsibly within society.
