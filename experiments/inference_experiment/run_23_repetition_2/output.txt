The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), including its definition, history, and applications. AI is a field of computer science that focuses on developing methods and software for machines to learn and exhibit intelligence. Some popular examples of AI include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. However, many AI applications are not labeled as such and have become commonplace in everyday life. The various subfields of AI research focus on different goals and techniques, including reasoning, natural language processing, and perception. General intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human, is also a long-term goal. AI researchers have adapted and integrated a range of techniques from different fields, such as search algorithms and artificial neural networks. Despite its many benefits, the use of AI has exposed unintended consequences and harms, leading to discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and ethical implications.
