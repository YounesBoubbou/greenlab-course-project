Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses systems that exhibit intelligence by perceiving their environment and using learning to achieve goals. Key applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools. AI research aims at traditional goals like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, and natural language processing. Recent advancements, particularly in deep learning and the transformer architecture, have fueled a significant boom in AI investment since 2017. However, this rapid growth has also raised concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and potential risks, leading to calls for regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
