The provided technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of research that enables machines to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. AI has various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal is to achieve general intelligence, allowing machines to complete tasks on an at least equal level as humans. To reach this goal, researchers have adapted and integrated techniques from multiple fields, including search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, neural networks, and statistics. AI has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, with a significant increase in funding and interest after 2012 due to deep learning advancements. The widespread use of AI has exposed unintended consequences and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions on regulatory policies for safety and benefits.
