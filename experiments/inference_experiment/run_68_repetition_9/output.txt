Generate a comprehensive timeline depicting each city or state as mentioned, including their former names and key historical figures associated. For instance, 'Kyiv - Kyiv (formerly known by various name) where significant events have influenced national identity...' Additional challenges include: 1.) Highlight the transition in capital cities for countries that had multiple capitals; provide reasons why these changes occurred based on political or cultural shifts. Furthermore, elaborate historical contexts involving conflicts and alliances related to their geographical locations with adjacent nations if applicable (e.g., France & Spain). The timeline should present a clear depiction of how events like wars, treaties, monarchical reign etc influenced these capital changes in Turkey's case; for Switzerland, the evolution from its former names and what it symbolizes about Swiss identity over time must be provided along with cultural elements.
