Global efforts focus on renewables like solar/wind for climate change combat due to tech growth & cost reduction; intermittency issues demand storage solutions and grid adjustments. Policies encourage transition, but reaching carbon neutrality calls for combined efficiency gains, sustainable infrastructure, and worldwide cooperation within 50 words constraint.

Essentially: The adoption of renewables is driven by tech improvements; intermittency issues require storage & grid updates with policy incentives steering the transition towards carbon neutrality through efficiency gains, sustainable infrastructure, and international efforts under a word limit challenge.
