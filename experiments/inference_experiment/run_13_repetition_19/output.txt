The Industrial Revolution's legacy is evident in the escalating greenhouse gas emissions, which have led to increased global temperatures. To mitigate these effects, international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015) were signed. These accords aimed to reduce emissions through various mechanisms, such as carbon pricing and renewable energy investments.

In response to climate change, significant economic advancements have emerged:

1.  **Renewable Energy Growth**: Investments in solar and wind power have led to a substantial increase in clean energy production, with costs decreasing by over 70% since 2010.
2.  **Electric Vehicle Adoption**: Governments and companies are incentivizing the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with many countries setting targets for EV adoption. Norway, for instance, aims to become carbon-neutral by 2030, largely driven by its EV market share.
3.  **Carbon Capture and Storage**: Technological advancements have made carbon capture more efficient and cost-effective, enabling industries to reduce their emissions while producing energy.
4.  **Green Infrastructure Development**: Cities worldwide are incorporating green roofs, urban forests, and green corridors into their infrastructure plans, mitigating the urban heat island effect and promoting sustainable development.

Technologically, innovations in areas like:

1.  **Energy Storage**: Advancements in battery technology have improved energy efficiency and enabled greater adoption of intermittent renewable sources.
2.  **Smart Grids**: Intelligent grid systems optimize energy distribution, facilitating a transition to decentralized, low-carbon power generation.
3.  **Sustainable Materials**: The development of climate-resilient materials has reduced the carbon footprint of construction projects.

These developments demonstrate the potential for economic and technological innovation to address climate change.
