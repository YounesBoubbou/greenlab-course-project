Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses machine-based systems that exhibit human-like intelligence through perception, learning, and decision-making. Key applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, voice interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategic game play. AI research focuses on subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, and planning. Techniques range from formal logic to deep learning and neural networks. Founded in 1956, AI experienced multiple boom and bust cycles before a resurgence driven by deep learning and the transformer architecture post-2017. Today, AI investment is at an all-time high, yet concerns about unintended consequences and risks are growing, prompting calls for regulatory oversight to ensure ethical use.
