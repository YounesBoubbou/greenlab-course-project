This paper summarizes artificial intelligence (AI) as a branch within computer science focused on creating systems that exhibit intelligent behaviorâ€”learning, reasoning, language processing, perception, planning, support for robotics and goal achievement. AI applications span diverse areas including web search engines like Google Search, recommendation platforms such as those by Amazon or Netflix, virtual assistants (Siri/Alexa), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), generative tools (ChatGPT) and in strategy games where superhuman play is seen (chess, Go). The traditional AI research goals seek to develop reasoning abilities, knowledge representation skills, planning algorithms, learning mechanisms, natural language processing techniques, perception capabilities for machines. General intelligence remains a long-term goal of the field which utilizes various methods such as search and optimization maths, logic formalism, neural networks models, statistics tools among others while drawing insights from psychology or linguistics where relevant to AI understanding humans better. The paper recalls that despite high expectations in 1956 leading into periods of disappointment due to technological limitations (AI winter) followed by resurgence with deep learning advancements since the mid-2010s, and then billions being invested within a few years culminating an AI boom. However, concerns have been raised about unintended consequences such as job displacement or privacy invasion prompting conversations around regulatory policies for safe utilization of this powerful technology into the future.
