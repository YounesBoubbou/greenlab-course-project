 The article highlights how renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have become more accessible due to technological advancements and decreasing costs, contributing significantly to global efforts to fight climate change. However, the intermittent nature of these sources presents a challenge for energy systems. To address this, energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies are required. Incentives provided by policymakers are driving the transition towards renewable energy sources. Achieving carbon neutrality will require a comprehensive approach that incorporates not only energy efficiency but also sustainable infrastructure development and international collaboration.
