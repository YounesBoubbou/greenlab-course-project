 Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have become popular due to lower costs and improved technology. However, their intermittent nature requires solutions like energy storage and grid integration strategies. Governments offer incentives for the transition, but achieving carbon neutrality demands a holistic approach that includes energy efficiency and sustainable infrastructure development with international cooperation.
