 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment and take actions based on learned intelligence to achieve defined goals. Applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategy games. AI research focuses on traditional goals like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics, with the long-term goal of general intelligence. Techniques used include search, logic, neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. AI's history includes cycles of optimism and disappointment, with significant growth since 2012 due to deep learning and transformer architecture. However, the widespread use of AI has raised concerns about unintended consequences, harms, risks, and long-term effects, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
