43. Ukraine – Kyiv* 
**Note on Russia & Serbia - Due political reasons, these cities have had historical significance and currently serve important roles within their respective nations despite being mentioned separately here: Moscow is the capital where federal laws originate; Belgrade holds importance due to its sizeable population in Kosovo region.  
† Note on Slovakia – Bern (Switzerland) & Slovenia—Ljubljana* are not capitals but key cities within their countries with cultural, economic and political significance: both have rich histories contributing significantly towards European culture. 
(Please note that the status of Kosovo's capital is under dispute due to partial recognition by some nations.)
