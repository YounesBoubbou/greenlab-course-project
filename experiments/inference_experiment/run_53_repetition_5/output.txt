The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), defining it as machine intelligence that enables computers to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions towards achieving specific goals. Key applications include search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools like ChatGPT. AI research focuses on subfields such as reasoning, learning, perception, and natural language processing. The field has experienced multiple phases of growth and decline since its inception in 1956, with recent advancements driven by deep learning and the transformer architecture. Despite significant benefits, widespread use of AI has raised concerns about unintended consequences and long-term risks, prompting discussions on regulatory frameworks to ensure safety and ethical use.
