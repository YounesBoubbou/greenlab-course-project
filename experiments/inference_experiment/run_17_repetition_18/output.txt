The technical paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research that enables machines to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. AI has numerous applications, including advanced search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools. The various subfields of AI research focus on specific goals and use particular tools, such as artificial neural networks and formal logic. To reach the goal of general intelligence, researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques from multiple fields. AI has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, but funding and interest increased significantly after 2012 with the rise of deep learning. The widespread use of AI in recent years has exposed unintended consequences and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
