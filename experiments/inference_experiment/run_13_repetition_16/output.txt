The Industrial Revolution's legacy can be seen in the significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, a major driver of global warming. To mitigate this issue, international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015) have been established to address climate change. These efforts have led to various economic and technological advancements that have emerged as part of the response.

**Economic Advancements:**

1.  **Renewable Energy Growth**: Investments in solar, wind, hydroelectric power, and geothermal energy have increased significantly, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
2.  **Carbon Pricing Mechanisms**: Carbon pricing systems, such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, are being implemented to provide a financial incentive for emissions reduction.
3.  **Green Economy Development**: Governments are promoting green economy initiatives, which focus on sustainable development and low-carbon growth.

**Technological Advancements:**

1.  **Energy Efficiency Improvements**: Advances in building insulation, smart grids, and energy-efficient appliances have reduced energy consumption.
2.  **Electric Vehicle Adoption**: The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has transformed the transportation sector, reducing emissions from fossil fuel-based vehicles.
3.  **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**: CCS technology is being developed to capture CO2 emissions from industrial sources and store them underground.

These economic and technological advancements demonstrate a shift towards a low-carbon economy and highlight the potential for innovation in addressing climate change.
