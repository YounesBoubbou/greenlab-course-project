The provided technical paper gives an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, which aim to achieve different goals using various techniques such as search, mathematical optimization, neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI has been founded in 1956 and gone through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, but it experienced a significant increase in funding and interest after 2012 with the advent of deep learning and transformer architecture. However, the widespread use of AI also exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
