 Climate change is primarily caused by the increase of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), fossil fuel combustion for electricity, heat, and transportation is the largest single source of global CO2 emissions, accounting for around 63% of total GHG emissions in 2019.

Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are also potent greenhouse gases, with methane having a warming potential 25 times greater than CO2 over a 100-year time frame, and nitrous oxide having a warming potential 310 times greater. The primary sources of methane emissions include agriculture (46%), fossil fuel production and processing (17%), waste management (15%), and enteric fermentation in livestock (33%). Nitrous oxide emissions come mostly from agriculture, particularly from the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers (78%) and animal manure management (12%).

The energy sector, specifically fossil fuel extraction, production, and combustion, is the largest contributor to total GHG emissions across all industries. In 2019, it accounted for approximately 64% of global CO2 emissions. The power sector, which includes electricity, heat, and cogeneration, was responsible for about 37% of energy-related CO2 emissions that year. Transportation, particularly road transport, accounted for around 15%.

Industrial processes, such as the production of cement, steel, chemicals, and other materials, contributed approximately 21% to global GHG emissions in 2019. The agricultural sector was responsible for around 24%, primarily due to livestock farming and rice cultivation. Waste management accounted for about 3% of global emissions.

In summary, fossil fuel combustion is the largest contributor to CO2 emissions, while methane and nitrous oxide come from agriculture and waste management, respectively. Energy production and transportation are the primary industries emitting GHGs, with industrial processes, agriculture, and waste management also contributing significantly. Understanding these sources and their variations across different industries is crucial in developing effective strategies for mitigating climate change.
