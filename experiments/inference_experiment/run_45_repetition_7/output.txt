Climate change is driven by the increase of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in Earth's atmosphere, which trap heat from the sun leading to global warming. Amongst GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most significant contributor because it is largely emitted through human activities related to fossil fuel combustion. This primarily occurs when we burn coal for electricity generation, oil and gas in transportation, manufacturing processes, and heating or cooling buildings. 

Methane and nitrous oxide also significantly contribute to climate change but are less abundant compared to CO2. The primary sources of methane emissions include agriculture (livestock digestion and manure management), fossil fuel extraction and production (both on land and under the sea), and waste management from landfills, paper industries, and wastewater systems. Nitrous oxide primarily comes from agricultural practices such as fertilizers and livestock activities, particularly when urine washes off fields into waterways.

In terms of industry-wise distribution, fossil fuels and energy sector are major contributors globally since they rely heavily on the extraction and combustion of coal, oil, and gas. Transportation (car, truck, and aircraft) is another significant source due to its dependence on burning gasoline and diesel for fuel. Agriculture encompasses emissions from both livestock farming practices and fertilizer use. Lastly, industrial processes like cement production or steel manufacturing also contribute to CO2 emissions through energy usage.

Understanding these sources allows us to target specific areas for emission reductions - switching to cleaner energy sources for the fossil fuels sector, improving agricultural techniques to reduce methane output in agriculture, managing waste better for the waste industry, and enhancing transportation efficiency could all play a significant role in mitigating climate change.
