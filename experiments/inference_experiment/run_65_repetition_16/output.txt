The provided technical paper offers insights into Artificial Intelligence (AI), defining it as a branch of computer science focused on enabling machines to perceive environments, learn, adapt, reason, and achieve goals autonomously. The field has evolved through cycles influenced by breakthrough technologies like deep learning and transformers since 2012, leading to increased funding and widespread application in areas such as search engines, recommendation systems, conversational interfaces (e.g., Google Assistant), self-driving cars, creative tools, strategy games analysis, but also extends into other nonperceived AI applications. Despite its successes, the paper acknowledges that pervasive usage of AI raises unintended consequences and potential risks necessitating regulatory considerations for safety and societal benefit. The origins of artificial intelligence date back to 1956 when it was established as an academic discipline, experiencing fluctuations in funding and optimism known as 'AI winters.' However, the paper notes a significant investment boom starting from around 2017 due to transformer architecture advancements. AI's multidisciplinary nature incorporates techniques spanning logic, mathematics, economics, psychology, linguistics and moreâ€”a testament to its diverse research landscape aimed at mimicking human-like intelligence in machines.
