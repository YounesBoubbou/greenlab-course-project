 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer science field that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve goals. Applications range from search engines to autonomous vehicles, although many are not labeled as AI. Traditional AI research goals include reasoning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. Techniques used include optimization, logic, neural networks, and statistics. AI was founded in 1956, experiencing cycles of optimism and disappointment until a resurgence after 2012 with deep learning and transformer architecture. Widespread use exposes unintended consequences and raises concerns about safety and future impacts, prompting regulatory discussions.
