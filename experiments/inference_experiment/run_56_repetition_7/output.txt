 The European Union is made up of 27 member states, each with its own capital city. Some of these cities have been used as EU headquarters and serve as seats for institutions such as the European Commission, Council, and Parliament. Here are the capitals of all 27 EU countries:

1. Berlin – Germany
2. Brussels – Belgium
3. Copenhagen – Denmark
4. Dublin – Ireland
5. Luxembourg – Luxembourg
6. Amsterdam – Netherlands
7. Paris – France
8. Rome – Italy
9. Warsaw – Poland
10. Vienna – Austria
11. Stockholm – Sweden
12. Tallinn – Estonia
13. Nicosia – Cyprus
14. Helsinki – Finland
15. Prague – Czech Republic
16. Sofia – Bulgaria
17.Brussels-Luxembourg – Belgium
18. Strasbourg -France
19. Luxembourg – Luxembourg
20. Reykjavík -Iceland
21. Brussels – Belgium
22. Oslo – Norway
23. Warsaw – Poland
24. Tallinn – Estonia
25. Prague – Czech Republic
26. Copenhagen – Denmark
27. Berlin – Germany

As you can see, each country has its own capital city, and some cities have multiple roles as both EU headquarters and seats for institutions. For example, Brussels serves as the seat of the European Commission, Council, and Parliament, but it is also a major financial center in Europe.

These are just some of the facts about EU member states and their capitals. To learn more, you can do further research or consult reliable sources such as websites, books, or documentaries about the topic.


Consider an Artificial Intelligence system that has been trained on all EU countries' capitals, along with other information such as the country's economic status, population, area, etc. The system's function is to predict the future capital of a hypothetical new EU member state based on its characteristics. 

Let's say we have three candidate cities for this new EU country: City A, City B, and City C. We know the following information about these potential capitals:

1) City A has double the population of City B.
2) City B is larger than City A but smaller than City C in terms of land area.
3) City C is larger than City A in terms of population. 
4) The EU does not want a city that already has a similar name to an existing EU member state's capital.
5) The EU wants the new country to be centrally located within the member states, with cities having an equal chance to become capitals.
6) None of these three cities have a similar name to any existing EU member state's capital. 

Question: Based on this information and your knowledge of the properties of transitivity in logic, which city should ideally be selected as the new EU member country's capital?


Let's apply the property of transitivity first. The property states that if A > B and B > C, then A > C. This means that City C has more people than City A (from point 3) and City A has more population than City B (point 1). Therefore, by transitivity, City C must have more population than City B.

Next, we consider the location of these cities. From point 5, we know that the EU wants to centrally located cities with an equal chance for any city to become a capital. This implies that none of the three cities should be too far from existing capitals.

From points 2 and 3, City B is larger than City A in terms of land area but has less population than City C. From point 4, since none of these cities have similar names to existing EU member state's capitals, no city can be eliminated based on this criterion alone. 

In step3, we also used deductive logic, which states that if all premises are true and the conclusion follows from them, then the conclusion is also true. So, using point 5 and all the information gathered in steps 1-3, we could conclude that City B should ideally be the new EU member country's capital since it meets the criteria of being centrally located with equal chances for any city to become a capital, and has more land area than City A but less population than City C.

Answer: The new EU member country's capital should ideally be City B.
