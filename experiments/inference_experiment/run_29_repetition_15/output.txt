 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment and learn from data to take actions to achieve goals. Applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and strategy games. AI research includes subfields focusing on reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, robotics, and general intelligence. Techniques used include optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, and interdisciplinary fields. AI was founded in 1956 but went through cycles of optimism and disappointment called "AI winter." Funding surged after deep learning outperformed previous techniques, leading to an "AI boom" by the early 2020s. Unintended consequences and risks have prompted discussions on regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
