 The provided technical paper discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI), its applications, subfields, and historical development. AI is a computer science field that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve goals. Applications range from web search engines to autonomous vehicles. Subfields focus on areas like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. The ultimate goal is general intelligence. Techniques used include search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and statistics-based methods. AI was established in 1956, experienced periods of optimism and disappointment (AI winter), but saw a resurgence with deep learning after 2012. Today, hundreds of billions are invested in AI. However, its widespread use has raised concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and long-term effects, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
