The provided technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), a field that develops methods for machines to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. AI has various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The traditional goal of AI research is general intelligence, the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. To reach this goal, AI researchers have adapted and integrated techniques from various fields. AI has gone through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, but funding increased after 2012 with deep learning and 2017 with the transformer architecture. The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed unintended consequences and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
