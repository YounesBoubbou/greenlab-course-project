Renewable energy sources are key to combatting climate change. Technological advancements and decreasing costs have driven growth of solar and wind power. Energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies are needed to address intermittency challenges. Incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs are being used by policymakers to accelerate the transition. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach incorporating energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
