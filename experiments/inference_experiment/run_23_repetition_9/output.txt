Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines that exhibit learning and intelligence to achieve defined goals. Some high-profile applications of AI include web search engines, recommendation systems, human speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and superhuman play in strategy games. AI research includes subfields such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. General intelligence is a long-term goal. Techniques used in AI research include search and optimization, logic, neural networks, and statistical methods. Funding for AI increased after 2012 with deep learning and accelerated further with the transformer architecture. The widespread use of AI exposed unintended consequences and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions on regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
