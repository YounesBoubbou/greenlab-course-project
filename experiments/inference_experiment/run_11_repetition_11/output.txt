The provided technical paper discusses the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), its history, goals, and applications. AI is defined as intelligence exhibited by machines that enable them to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. The paper highlights various subfields of AI research, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of general intelligence - the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level - is also discussed. The paper notes that AI has gone through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, but recent advancements in deep learning and transformer architecture have led to increased funding and interest. The widespread use of AI has raised concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and long-term effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies for ensuring the safety and benefits of AI technology.
