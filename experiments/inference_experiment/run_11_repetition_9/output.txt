The provided technical paper discusses the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science that aims to develop machines capable of perceiving their environment and taking actions to achieve defined goals. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated various techniques from mathematics, statistics, computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The field has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, with a significant increase in funding and interest after 2012 with the development of deep learning and the transformer architecture. However, the widespread use of AI has also exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
