Renewable growth promising for climate change mitigation; solar & wind thrive with tech improvements & cost drops. However, their intermittency challenges energy systems reliability - necessitating advanced storage and grid solutions to ensure continuous supply. Policies like tax credits & feed-in tariffs aid transition acceleration. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a combined approach including efficiency measures, sustainable infrastructure development, international cooperation alongside renewables expansion.
