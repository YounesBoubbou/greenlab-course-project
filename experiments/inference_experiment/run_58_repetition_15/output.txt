 Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are crucial for climate change mitigation. Despite their growth, intermittency poses challenges that need to be addressed by developing energy storage technologies and integrating them into the grid. Incentives such as tax credits and feed-in tariffs encourage the transition. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach involving energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and global cooperation.
