The paper discusses the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its evolution. AI refers to machines that can perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to achieve defined goals. The subfields of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence is a long-term goal of AI research, aiming to enable machines to complete any task performable by humans on an at least equal level. To reach this goal, researchers have integrated techniques from various fields, including search, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The field has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winter, but the development of deep learning and transformer architecture led to a massive growth in funding and investment in AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
