Climate change is primarily driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation in the Earth's atmosphere. The most significant contributor to this process is carbon dioxide (CO2), chiefly because of human activities like burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas for energy generation, transportation, industry operations and commercial use. Methane (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O), though less abundant than CO2, are potent GHGs that contribute significantly to climate change due to their high global warming potential.

In terms of primary sources across different industries:

1. **Energy Sector**: The energy sector is the most significant contributor globally as it accounts for about two-thirds of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. This sector's main contributors include electricity generation (mostly from burning coal, natural gas and oil), heating and cooling buildings using fossil fuels or electricity, transport through the use of gasoline/diesel vehicles and industrial processes like cement production.

2. **Agriculture**: In agricultural activities, methane is a major contributor to GHG emissions mainly due to livestock farming (particularly cows, which produce methane during digestion) and rice paddy cultivation. Nitrous oxide emissions occur from manure management practices and synthetic fertilizer use.

3. **Land Use Change**: Activities such as deforestation for agriculture expansion or urban development lead to reduced carbon storage capacity of land ecosystems and contribute significantly to GHG emissions through CO2 release into the atmosphere and increased N2O and CH4 emissions from soil.

4. **Industrial Processes**: Industries like steel production, cement manufacturing, chemical synthesis (like ammonia), and other industrial processes that use fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases directly are major contributors to industrial GHG emissions.

5. **Waste Management**: Landfills releasing methane and burning waste releasing CO2 contribute significantly to GHG emissions from this sector. 

6. **Residential and Commercial Buildings**: Heating, cooling, lighting and the operation of electrical devices in buildings consume a significant amount of energy that often comes from fossil fuels, contributing to these sectors' emissions.

These industry-specific sources highlight the need for targeted mitigation strategies across different sectors to effectively tackle climate change.
