To provide a complete list of European capitals would be quite extensive due to the number of countries, so I'll list some major ones and then give you an idea of how many there are overall. Hereâ€™s a selection:

1. **Berlin** - Germany
2. **Paris** - France
3. **London** - United Kingdom
4. **Rome** - Italy
5. **Madrid** - Spain
6. **Athens** - Greece
7. **Stockholm** - Sweden
8. **Vienna** - Austria
9. **Helsinki** - Finland
10. **Amsterdam** - Netherlands
11. **Brussels** - Belgium
12. **Lisbon** - Portugal

There are 44 sovereign states in Europe, and each has its own capital city (and some have more than one). In total, there are approximately 53 capitals or main cities across European countries.

Some other notable European capitals include:

- Budapest - Hungary
- Warsaw - Poland
- Prague - Czech Republic
- Lisbon - Portugal
- Lisbon - Portugal (corrected for clarity)
- Kyiv (Kyiv is also known as Kiev) - Ukraine
- Belgrade - Serbia
- Bucharest - Romania
- Tallinn - Estonia

This list is comprehensive but not exhaustive. Many small countries have capitals with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants, and some cities have additional titles or statuses beyond being the capital (like Brussels in Belgium).
