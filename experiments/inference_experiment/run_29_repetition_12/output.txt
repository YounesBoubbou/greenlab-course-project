 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that develops methods for machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions based on defined goals. Applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategy games. AI research focuses on traditional goals such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics, with the ultimate goal of general intelligence. Techniques used include optimization, logic, neural networks, and statistics-based methods. AI was founded in 1956, went through periods of optimism and disappointment, and experienced a resurgence in the late 2010s due to deep learning and transformer architectures. The widespread use of AI exposed unintended consequences and concerns about safety and long-term effects, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
