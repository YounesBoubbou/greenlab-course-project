Climate change is primarily driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with carbon dioxide (CO₂) being the most significant contributor due to its extensive role in atmospheric warming. Other potent GHGs include methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). The primary sources of these emissions vary across different industries.

In the energy sector, which is one of the largest contributors, CO₂ emissions mainly stem from the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation, heating, and transportation. Methane leaks during the production, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution of natural gas also contribute significantly to GHG emissions in this sector.

Agriculture is another major source of both CO₂ and CH₄ emissions. While agriculture contributes around 10% of total global greenhouse gas emissions, it releases significant amounts of methane from livestock digestion (enteric fermentation) and manure management, as well as CO₂ from soil cultivation and burning agricultural waste. Nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions are primarily associated with the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers.

Forestry and land-use change contribute to GHG emissions through deforestation, which releases stored carbon into the atmosphere. Urban development and construction also emit CO₂ during cement production and building operations.

Industry sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and waste management each have unique sources of emissions. For instance, industrial processes can release direct emissions from activities like cement manufacture (CO₂) and fertilizer production (N₂O). Wastewater treatment plants are significant emitters of methane due to biological decomposition in anoxic environments.

Transportation is a major contributor, with CO₂ emitted primarily from the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels. Aircraft and shipping also emit considerable quantities of GHGs, including CH₄ and N₂O in addition to CO₂.

Understanding these sources helps tailor mitigation strategies across various industries to reduce overall emissions and combat climate change.
