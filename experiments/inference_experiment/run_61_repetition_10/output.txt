The Industrial Revolution (circa late 17th century onwards) instigated unprecedented industrial growth, but also led to drastic environmental changes such as increased greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming. To mitigate these impacts, international climate agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement came into force; however, their efficacy in reducing CO2 levels has been debated due mainly to varying national commitments and enforcement mechanisms.

The technological response emerging from this dialogue is multi-faceted with both traditional industries innovating sustainable practices as well as new sectors dedicated entirely to alternative energy sources, like solar and wind power generation - an example of green technology in practice today. Economic strategies have been equally diverse; carbon taxes are being implemented by some countries aiming at reducing fossil fuel use while others invest heavily into renewable energies subsidization as a means to transition from oil dependency without disrupting economic stability and growth, such is the case with Denmark's wind energy sector.

Furthermore, advancements in electric vehicles (EV) like Tesla have revolutionized transportation sectors by providing emission-free alternatives that are growing increasingly cost competitive due to economies of scale coupled with declining battery costs and improvements in efficiency resulting from ongoing research & development.

Finally, the application of smart grids is another example where technology aims towards creating more efficient energy distribution systems reducing wastage while integrating renewable sources smoothly into existing frameworks - it's an economic solution that also aligns with environmental goals by minimizing carbon footprint and optimizing resource utilization.

In conclusion, the response to climate change following Industrial Revolution has manifested through both technological advancements like smart grids or EV technology along side varied strategic approaches at national policies level such as subsidies for renewables - all contributing towards a future that is increasingly less dependent on fossil fuels. Despite these efforts, the world still faces significant challenges in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and maintaining economic growth simultaneously â€“ it's an issue which will require continued innovation, collaboration between nations, as well as commitment from all sectors of society to achieve meaningful progress towards mitigating climate change impact.
