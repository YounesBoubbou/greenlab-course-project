The provided technical paper discusses the concept of artificial intelligence (AI), which refers to machines' ability to learn, perceive their environment, and take actions to achieve specific goals. AI is a broad field of research in computer science that incorporates various techniques from mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and other fields. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics, with general intelligence being an ultimate long-term goal. AI has been founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and experienced multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment throughout its history. Recent advancements in deep learning, transformer architecture, and the increasing investment in AI have led to the widespread use of AI in various applications, such as web search engines, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. However, this growth has also exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
