Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. This encompasses machine perception and learning capabilities that allow computers to perform tasks requiring human-like decision-making abilities, such as web search, recommendations, speech interaction, autonomous driving, generative art, and superhuman game strategy play. AI's primary goals include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, robotics, and achieving general intelligence on par with humans. Techniques like search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc., are used to adapt and integrate AI research towards these goals. However, the field has experienced several cycles of optimism followed by disappointment during funding downturns known as AI winters. A significant resurgence occurred in 2017 with the advent of the transformer architecture, fueling an unprecedented investment boom into AI infrastructure worth hundreds of billions of dollars by early 2020s. The widespread adoption also brought unforeseen consequences and ethical concerns about AI's safety, benefits, and potential long-term impacts on society, prompting regulatory discussions for oversight.
