The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change include both human activities and natural processes. Among anthropogenic sources, fossil fuel combustion is the most significant contributor, responsible for approximately 76% of global CO₂ emissions (IPCC, 2019). This activity is prevalent across various industries but predominantly in energy production (38%), industry (24%), and transportation (15%). Methane (CH₄) mainly originates from agricultural practices such as rice cultivation (40%) and livestock farming (32%), along with waste management, which accounts for 17% of CH₄ emissions. Nitrous oxide (N₂O), largely emitted through fertilizer use in agriculture (68%) and waste treatment processes (29%), constitutes a smaller but still significant portion.

These sources vary significantly across different industries. For instance, the energy sector relies heavily on fossil fuels for electricity generation and heating, while agriculture is a primary source of both methane and nitrous oxide emissions due to livestock and fertilizer use. In contrast, deforestation primarily contributes to CO₂ through land-use changes, whereas transportation emits significant amounts of CO₂ from vehicle fuel combustion.

Understanding these sources and their variations across industries is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies tailored to specific sectors and activities.
