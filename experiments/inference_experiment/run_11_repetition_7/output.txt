The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science that aims to develop and study methods for machines to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. AI has various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal is general intelligence, which enables machines to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. To reach this goal, AI researchers have adapted and integrated techniques from various fields, including search, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The paper also discusses the history of AI, including its founding in 1956, periods of optimism and disappointment, and the current boom following advancements in deep learning and transformer architecture.
