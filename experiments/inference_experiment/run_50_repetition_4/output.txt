Not all European countries have their capital within the country's borders or on its main landmass, and some countries span multiple continents. As such, listing the capitals of all European countries would be quite extensive due to the number of nations (currently 50) recognized by the United Nations as fully independent states in Europe. However, I can provide a summary of several major capital cities:

1. **Albania** - Tirana
2. **Andorra** - Andorra la Vella
3. **Armenia** - Yerevan
4. **Austria** - Vienna
5. **Belarus** - Minsk
6. **Belgium** - Brussels (though not the largest city, it is where most government institutions are located)
7. **Bosnia and Herzegovina** - Sarajevo
8. **Bulgaria** - Sofia
9. **Croatia** - Zagreb
10. **Cyprus** - Nicosia (Northern Cyprus is occupied by Turkey; the Republic of Cyprus claims all territory, but most countries recognize only the southern part)
11. **Czech Republic** - Prague
12. **Denmark** - Copenhagen
13. **Estonia** - Tallinn
14. **Finland** - Helsinki
15. **France** - Paris
16. **Germany** - Berlin (though Bonn was the capital during parts of the 20th century)
17. **Greece** - Athens
18. **Hungary** - Budapest
19. **Iceland** - Reykjavik
20. **Ireland** - Dublin
21. **Italy** - Rome

For a complete and up-to-date list, including those countries with capitals in territories that are not part of the main landmass (like Monaco), it's best to consult a reliable source or database dedicated to this information.

Some notable mentions include:
- **Malta** has two official capital cities: Valletta is the national capital, and Rabat is the seat of government.
- **Montenegro** - Podgorica
- **North Macedonia** - Skopje (formerly known as Vardar)
- **North Cyprus** (recognized only by Turkey) - Nicosia (as mentioned earlier)
- **Portugal** - Lisbon
- **Romania** - Bucharest
- **Russia** - Moscow (though it spans two continents, European Russia is considered part of Europe)

This list does not include all capitals but covers the majority. Each country has unique historical and political contexts that influence its capital city's location and significance.
