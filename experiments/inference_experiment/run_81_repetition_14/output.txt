Greenhouse gas emissions arise from various sources, heavily impacting industries differently:

**Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):**

* **Electricity & Heat Production:** Burning fossil fuels for electricity generation is the largest contributor to CO₂ emissions globally. Coal-fired power plants are particularly significant.
* **Transportation:** Vehicles relying on gasoline and diesel release substantial CO₂ during combustion. The transportation sector's contribution is amplified by increasing global travel demand.
* **Industry:** Manufacturing processes, cement production, and steel manufacturing all involve fossil fuel use and release significant CO₂ emissions.

**Methane (CH₄):**

* **Agriculture:** Livestock farming, particularly cattle, produces methane as a byproduct of digestion. Rice cultivation and fertilizer use also contribute.
* **Natural Gas & Oil:** Extraction, processing, and transportation of natural gas can leak methane into the atmosphere. 
* **Waste Management:** Decomposing organic waste in landfills releases methane.

**Nitrous Oxide (N₂O):**

* **Agriculture:** Fertilizers containing nitrogen compounds release N₂O during application and breakdown in soil.
* **Industrial Processes:** Certain chemical manufacturing processes, such as nitric acid production, emit significant amounts of N₂O.


Addressing these emissions requires a multifaceted approach involving renewable energy adoption, fuel efficiency improvements, sustainable agricultural practices, and stricter regulations on industrial emissions.
