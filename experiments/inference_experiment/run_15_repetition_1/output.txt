The primary sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), can be attributed to various sectors and activities. The most significant contributors include:

1.  **Energy Sector**: Fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation, transportation, and industrial processes accounts for approximately 65% of global GHG emissions.
2.  **Agriculture**: Livestock farming and land-use changes (deforestation) contribute to methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which are respectively responsible for around 30% and 20% of the total agricultural sector's emissions.
3.  **Industrial Processes**: Cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical synthesis all involve energy-intensive processes that release large amounts of CO2 and other GHGs.

Breaking down these sectors further, we find that:

*   Energy generation (electricity, heat, and transport) accounts for around 50% of total emissions.
*   Agriculture is responsible for about 25%.
*   Industry contributes roughly 20%, with cement production being one of the most significant sources within this category.
*   Land-use changes, including deforestation, are estimated to account for around 15%.

It's worth noting that while these sectors and activities contribute significantly to GHG emissions, there is considerable variation in their impact across different industries.
