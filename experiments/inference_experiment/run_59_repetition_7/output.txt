 The article provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), which is a field of research in computer science that focuses on developing and studying methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment, learn from experience, and use this knowledge to take actions towards achieving defined goals. It discusses how AI has been implemented in various high-profile applications such as web search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, generative art tools, and strategy games. The article also explains that many of these advanced technologies are now considered essential for our daily lives and have become so common that they no longer receive the label of "artificial intelligence." It highlights some of the subfields within AI research such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence is one of the long-term goals of AI research, but reaching it requires adapting various techniques from different fields, including mathematics, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The article also mentions the history of AI, which has seen cycles of optimism followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, also known as "AI winter." However, after the advent of deep learning in 2012 and the transformer architecture in 2017, AI experienced a significant boom in investment and interest. This growth was further accelerated in the early 2020s, with hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI technology. The article also touches upon some of the unintended consequences and risks associated with AI's widespread use, leading to discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and maximize its benefits for society.
