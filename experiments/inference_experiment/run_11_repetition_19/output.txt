The paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science. AI is intelligence exhibited by machines that can perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. The subfields of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics, with the long-term goal of achieving general intelligence. To reach this goal, AI researchers have adapted various techniques from fields such as psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. Despite multiple "AI winters," funding and interest increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous techniques, and accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. The widespread use of AI has exposed unintended consequences and harms, raising concerns about its risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of AI technology.
