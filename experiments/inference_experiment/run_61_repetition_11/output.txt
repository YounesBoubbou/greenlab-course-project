The Industrial Revolution (IR), which began around the mid-18th century, unleashed an era of rapid industrial growth and urbanization with profound economic gains but also environmental degradation due to fossil fuel reliance. A pivotal repercussion has been the increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting in global warming—a phenomenon now widely recognized as a major threat, impacting economies worldwide.

In response, international efforts like the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and Paris Agreement (2015), which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, have been instrumental in galvanizing governments to act against climate change. Technological advancements are also contributing significantly toward mitigating its impacts as part of the response—from renewable energy sources like solar and wind power being increasingly adopted due to their scalability and environmental benefits over fossil fuels, which release massive amounts of carbon dioxide when burnt for electricity.

Additionally, advancements in battery technology have made it possible to store surplus green energy effectively during peak production times—facilitating the transition from non-renewable sources towards renewables on a larger scale. Smart grids and microgrids are also emerging as innovative solutions for efficient electricity distribution, which reduces overall energy wastage within our consumption systems while promoting decentralized power generation via small-scale solar panels or wind turbines in local communities—further reducing the carbon footprint.

Furthermore, electrifying public transportation is another critical advancement that has emerged as a response to climate change by minimizing vehicular emissions and pollutants released into our atmosphere while simultaneously offering more reliable modes of commuting for citizens in densely populated cities where traffic congestion can be severe.

In conclusion, the global society's concerted efforts towards economic growth must now prioritize sustainability through technological advancements that promote renewable energy sources and environmentally conscious manufacturing practices—reducing our reliance on fossil fuels while simultaneously safeguarding a livable planet for generations to come.
