32. Macedonia - Skopje     
33. Malta – Valletta   
34. Moldova - Chișinău  
35. Monaco (city)—Monaco City with Monte Carlo as a secondary center, but no separate administrative capital; Principalities of Mentone and Rainholdt are associated centers     
36. Montenegro – Podgorica    
37. Netherlands - Amsterdam is constitutionally the country's de facto "capital" due to government seat in The Hague, although Den Haag has official status as capital city; Willemstad also serves significant political and cultural role         
38. Norway (Oslo)   
39. Poland – Warsaw    
40. Portugal - Lisbon  
41. Romania (Bucharest since 1862, before that the Principality of Moldavia used Iași as its capital.)— Bucharest

44. Serbia - Belgrade    
45. Slovakia—Bratislava   
46. Slovenia (Ljubljana)– Ljubljana

49. Sweden - Stockholm   
50. Switzerland – Bern serves as de facto national meeting place and headquarters for federal authorities though not the legislative seat (Zürich is home to parliament); Lucerne, also a historic city with central bank presence; Chur acts in cultural capacity    
51. Turkey— Ankara officially since 1920 but Istanbul retains significant historical importance as former capital  
52. Ukraine – Kyiv (also called Kiev)   
53. United Kingdom - London, while actual government administration is based at Westminster and other centers; Scotland has Edinburgh for administrative center    
54. Vatican City State— The Holy See's own territory within Rome  
55. Western Sahara (SADR state claims El Aaiún as its capital but the situation remains disputed due to Moroccan control) - Laayoune/Al-Yawm    
56. Yemen – Sana'a   
57. All of Europe has significant cities like Paris, London and Berlin that serve not only administrative purposes but also cultural ones which are considered by many as unofficial or alternative capitals due to their global importance beyond mere political capital statuses. 

It is important to acknowledge the complexities within regions such as Cyprus with Greek Cypriot community recognizing Nicosia and Turkish-occupied north claiming cities like North Nairoundjevan/Northern Kouroum Sande in recognition of their distinct identities. Similarly, Kosovo's de facto status adds layers to its claimed capital city which serves as a significant focal point for self-declared governance and identity amidst international disputes regarding sovereignery.

It is noteworthy that historical capitals have changed over time due to political evolution, warfare, or social transformations; thus the role of cities can evolve beyond strict administrative functions into symbols of cultural heritage and national pride for many countries in Europe.
