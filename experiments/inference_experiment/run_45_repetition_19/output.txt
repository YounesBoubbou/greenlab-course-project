Climate change results from human activities that increase greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming and related impacts. The major driver is carbon dioxide (CO2) emission due to fossil fuel combustion for energy production, transportation, industry processes, and land use changes such as deforestation. Methane and nitrous oxide, while accounting for a smaller share of total emissions, are potent greenhouse gases that contribute significantly to global warming.

Fossil fuels - coal, oil, natural gas - are the largest source of CO2 emissions worldwide (approximately 75% globally). In terms of geographical distribution, China leads with the highest total fossil fuel combustion emissions due to its large industrial base and population. The United States follows in second place with a focus on coal use for electricity generation.

Methane comes primarily from agriculture (livestock manure management and rice paddies), oil and gas production, and landfills worldwide, contributing about 17% of global emissions. In the US, the agricultural sector contributes roughly half of methane emissions due to livestock and manure management. In contrast, Russia and China are significant emitters in this category as well.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is mainly emitted from agriculture through synthetic fertilizer use and soil management practices, particularly on cropland and rice paddies worldwide. It represents around 7% of total emissions globally. N2O is also released from industrial activities like the production of chemical fertilizers and steel manufacturing as well as fossil fuel combustion.

These emissions vary across different industries due to their specific energy demands and resource consumption patterns. For instance, transportation relies heavily on fossil fuels while agriculture contributes significantly through methane and nitrous oxide releases during cultivation, livestock management, and waste disposal. To mitigate climate change, efforts focus on reducing fossil fuel dependency, enhancing efficiency in energy usage, adopting cleaner technologies, promoting renewable sources like wind and solar power, and implementing sustainable agricultural practices that minimize greenhouse gas emissions.
