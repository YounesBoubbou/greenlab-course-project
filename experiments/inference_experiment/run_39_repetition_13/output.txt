Climate change is a complex issue driven primarily by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The major contributors to these emissions include fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, agriculture, and transportation.

Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are burned in power plants, vehicles, and home heating systems. This emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, accounting for about 70% of total GHG emissions.

Industrial processes, especially those involving metals extraction, manufacturing, and construction, release significant amounts of methane (about 4%) and nitrous oxide (about 3%). 

Agriculture is another major contributor, particularly through livestock manure management, which releases methane. Additionally, the use of fertilizers in agriculture contributes to nitrous oxide emissions.

Finally, transportation systems, including cars, trucks, and airplanes, emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide due to combustion.

To address these emissions, various strategies are employed across industries. These include transitioning to cleaner energy sources like renewable wind or solar power, improving energy efficiency in processes and buildings, promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and investing in public transportation infrastructure.
