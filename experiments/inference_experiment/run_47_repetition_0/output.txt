The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), a field that aims for machines to exhibit intelligent behavior through learning from their environment. AI applications vary greatly but include web searches, recommendations, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategic game analysis. The pursuit encompasses reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. Goals include developing general intelligence equivalent to human levels. Techniques used range from search optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, and economics. AI's roots lie in the academic discipline founded in 1956, experiencing cycles of optimism and disappointment before a resurgence post-2012 due to advancements like deep learning and the transformer architecture. This growth has led to significant investment and widespread use, though it raises concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and long-term effects that necessitate regulatory considerations for ensuring technology safety and benefits.
