The technical paper presents a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI), tracing its origins as an academic discipline established in 1956, through various periods characterized by fluctuating optimism and funding. It emphasizes AI's evolution from traditional goals such as reasoning and learning to subfields like natural language processing and robotics that leverage deep learning techniques for significant advancements post-2017 with the transformer architecture, leading to an "AI boom." While showcasing high-profile applications in web search engines, recommendation systems, conversational AI (e.g., Google Assistant), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), and creative tools like ChatGPT and AI art that blend into daily life without explicit identification as "AI," the paper recognizes these advancements' seamless integration challenges conventional labeling of technology as AI when it becomes widely used. The document highlights ethical considerations, regulatory policy discussions to ensure safe utilization and mitigate unintended consequences amidst accelerated technological growth in the early 2020s, with substantial investments fueling continuous innovation while acknowledging potential long-term effects on society.
