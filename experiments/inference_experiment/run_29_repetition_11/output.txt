 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that develops methods for machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. Applications range from search engines and recommendation systems to robotics and generative tools. AI research includes subfields like reasoning, natural language processing, and perception, with the long-term goal of general intelligence. Techniques used include optimization, logic, neural networks, and statistics. Founded in 1956, AI has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment, with recent growth driven by deep learning and transformer architectures. Widespread use has raised concerns about unintended consequences and future risks, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
