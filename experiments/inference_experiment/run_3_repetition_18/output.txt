Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor. The main source of CO2 emissions comes from fossil fuel combustion, specifically the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production and transportation. Other significant sources of GHGs include methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are emitted through human activities such as agriculture, waste management, and industrial processes.

The distribution of GHG emissions across different industries varies significantly. The energy sector is the largest contributor to GHG emissions, accounting for around 60% of total emissions. This is primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation, heating, and transportation. Industrial processes, such as cement production and metal processing, also contribute significantly to GHG emissions.

Agriculture is another important sector when it comes to GHG emissions, with around 14% of total emissions coming from activities like livestock farming, fertilizer use, and land-use changes. The waste management sector, including landfills and methane capture systems, accounts for around 5% of GHG emissions.

In terms of individual sources, the largest source of CO2 emissions is the burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation, accounting for around 40% of total emissions. Industrial processes, such as cement production and metal processing, are also significant contributors to GHG emissions, accounting for around 15%. Agriculture and waste management each contribute around 10% of total emissions.

Overall, the primary sources of GHG emissions come from human activities like energy production and transportation, agriculture, and industrial processes. To effectively address climate change, it is essential to reduce emissions from these sectors through the transition to renewable energy sources, increased energy efficiency, and improved land-use practices.
