The Industrial Revolution, while marked as a pivotal moment, also triggered significant economic and technological advancements in response to growing concerns over climate change.

Economically, the shift towards renewable energy sources became a focal point for economic growth. Solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems started to replace fossil fuels, creating new industries such as green construction and energy storage.

Technologically, advancements in clean technologies were pivotal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For example:

1. Carbon capture and storage (CCS): This technology captures carbon dioxide emissions before they enter the atmosphere. Several large-scale CCS facilities are already operational.

2. Electric vehicles (EVs): The widespread adoption of EVs has significantly reduced the carbon footprint of transportation. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, nearly 150 million passenger cars on the road worldwide will be electric by 2040.

In summary, the response to climate change during and following the Industrial Revolution has been marked by significant economic shifts towards renewable energy and technological advancements in clean technologies. These efforts continue to shape our world as we strive for a sustainable future.
