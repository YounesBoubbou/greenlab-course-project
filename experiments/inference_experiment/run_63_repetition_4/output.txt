Climate change is primarily propelled by rising levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the Earth's atmosphere. These emissions result from human activities, particularly fossil fuel combustion which accounts for over 75% of CO2 production worldwide according to studies by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

CO2 is mainly produced through industrial processes like cement manufacturing and energy-intensive industries. It's also released from natural sources such as volcanoes, though anthropogenic emissions far surpass these. Fossil fuel combustion in power plants for electricity generation contributes significantly to CO2 levels; transportation sectors like cars and trucks accounted for 16% of global GHG emissions according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Methane, which is over twice as potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide on a per-molecule basis but shorter lived in the atmosphere, primarily comes from agriculture and waste treatment. Livestock production generates methane through enteric fermentation processes; while rice paddies produce it due to anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Landfills also release significant amounts as a result of decomposing biomass under oxygen-deprived conditions, with the IEA citing them for 15% contribution globally in recent times.

Nitrous oxide emissions mainly arise from agricultural activities including intensive farming and use of nitrogen fertilizers which lead to soil microbial processes converting organic matter into N2O, as reported by the IPCC. It also results partly due to industrial applications like production of nylon and other synthetic fibers through chemical reactions involving ammonia or nitric acid at high temperatures under pressure â€“ a lesser yet considerable contributor accounting for about 6% global emissions according to estimates from Greenpeace International.

Across different industries, energy production leads as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions with contributions ranging between transportation (14% globally) and residential & commercial sectors combined together making up roughly one-third each in developed countries like USA while these proportions vary significantly across developing nations due to differing stages of industrialization, energy use patterns. It's evident that tackling climate change requires a holistic approach addressing emissions from multiple sources with focused strategies for both mitigation and adaptation depending on local context and capabilities as per guidance by bodies like the IPCC and UNEP.

This analysis underscores how human activities, particularly in energy-intensive industries such as electricity generation (fossil fuels), transportation (petroleum products) along with agricultural practices that generate methane & nitrous oxide emissions contribute significantly to climate change through their GHG footprints. Efforts for reducing these impact must involve comprehensive strategies across different sectors accounting the industry-specific emission patterns and tailored approaches suitable to local conditions as per international guidelines provided by scientific bodies such as IPCC & UNEP, along with continued research into emerging technologies like carbon capture storage (CCS) systems that could potentially help in reducing these emissions.
