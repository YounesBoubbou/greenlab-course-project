## Primary Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Across Industries

**Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**

* **Power generation:** 25% - Burning coal and natural gas for electricity.
* **Transportation:** 23% - Emissions from vehicles and airplanes.
* **Industrial processes:** 21% - Manufacturing and production processes.
* **Residential and commercial buildings:** 14% - Heating and cooling of buildings.


**Methane (CH4)**

* **Agriculture:** 37% - Emissions from livestock digestion and landfills.
* **Waste management:** 20% - Decomposition of organic matter in landfills.
* **Energy production:** 9% - Natural gas leaks and decomposition of organic matter in biogas production.

**Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**

* **Agriculture:** 65% - Emissions from fertilizers and manure management.
* **Waste management:** 13% - Decomposition of organic matter in landfills.
* **Industrial processes:** 9% - Production of nitric acid and other fertilizers.

**Variations Across Industries:**

* **Energy:** High CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion.
* **Transportation:** High CO2 and methane emissions from vehicle travel.
* **Agriculture:** High methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock and fertilizers.
* **Industry:** High CO2 emissions from various processes, along with nitrous oxide from industrial chemicals.
* **Buildings:** High CO2 emissions from heating and cooling, with variations depending on climate and building materials.

**Factors influencing emissions:**

* Production volume and technology used
* Raw material and energy sources
* Process efficiency
* Emission control measures

**Conclusion:**

Greenhouse gas emissions are widespread across industries, with power generation, transportation, and agriculture being the largest sources. Addressing climate change requires comprehensive action to reduce emissions from all sectors.
