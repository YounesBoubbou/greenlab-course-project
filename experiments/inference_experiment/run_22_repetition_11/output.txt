The adoption of renewable energy sources is crucial in fighting climate change. Technological advancements and decreasing costs have led to the growth of solar and wind power. However, intermittency poses a challenge, necessitating energy storage and grid integration strategies. Policymakers use incentives to accelerate transition, but achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach that incorporates energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
