The paper provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of AI research is to achieve general intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an equal level. The paper highlights the different techniques used in AI, such as search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. It also discusses the history of AI, including its founding in 1956 and multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment known as AI winters. The recent growth of AI funding and interest, fueled by the transformer architecture, has led to concerns about unintended consequences and harms in the present and future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
