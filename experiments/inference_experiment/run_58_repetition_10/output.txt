 Renewable energy is growing due to technological advancements and decreasing costs. However, the intermittency of these sources poses challenges for energy systems that need energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers have implemented incentives such as tax credits and feed-in tariffs to accelerate the transition. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach, including energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
