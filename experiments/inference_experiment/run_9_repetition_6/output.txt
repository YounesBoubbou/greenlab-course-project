The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, can be attributed to various industries and activities. Fossil fuel combustion, primarily from the energy sector, is the largest contributor to CO2 emissions. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the energy sector accounted for approximately 65% of global CO2 emissions in 2019.

The industrial processes of cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical processing also release significant amounts of CO2, nitrous oxide, and methane. The agriculture sector is another major source of emissions, primarily due to livestock farming and rice cultivation, which account for around 24% of global methane emissions.

In the transportation sector, burning fossil fuels in vehicles, aircraft, and ships contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial processes, such as cement production and steel manufacturing, also release significant amounts of CO2 and nitrous oxide. The industrial process of natural gas processing and transmission is another substantial source of methane emissions.

In terms of variations across different industries, the energy sector is the largest contributor to CO2 emissions, while agriculture is the primary source of methane emissions. The industrial processes of cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical processing release significant amounts of CO2, nitrous oxide, and methane.
