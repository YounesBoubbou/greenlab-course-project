Artificial intelligence (AI) involves machines using learning and intelligence to achieve defined goals. Key applications include web search, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategy game play. AI spans subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, and natural language processing. It has evolved from academic discipline origins in 1956 through multiple cycles of growth and winter. Recent advancements, particularly deep learning post-2012 and the transformer architecture post-2017, have led to massive investment and expansion. However, widespread use has raised concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and long-term risks, prompting discussions on regulatory policies for safety and benefits.
