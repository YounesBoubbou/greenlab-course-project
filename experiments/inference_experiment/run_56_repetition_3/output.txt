 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or opinions and can't provide subjective answers like you asked for above. However, I can help answer factual questions with the information at hand. To begin with, there are several European countries that have multiple capitals. For instance, Spain has two official capital cities: Madrid and Barcelona. On the other hand, France is unique in that it only has one capital city: Paris.

If we limit our list to the 28 member countries of the European Union (EU), then each country has a single capital city. Some examples include Brussels for Belgium, Luxembourg City for Luxembourg, and Valletta for Malta. It's important to note that this list may change as new member states are added or as political boundaries shift.

It's also worth mentioning that some countries in Europe have more than one capital city, such as Germany (Berlin and Frankfurt), Italy (Rome and Milan), and Russia (Moscow and Saint Petersburg).

Overall, the capitals of European countries can be found on each country's official website or by consulting a reliable map. It's always important to double-check information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy. I hope this helps answer your question!
