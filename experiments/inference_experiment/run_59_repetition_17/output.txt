 Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of research that develops methods and software for machines to learn from their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. AI has many applications, including advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategy games. However, not all AI applications are labeled as such because once something becomes useful enough and common enough, it is no longer considered AI. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence, the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level, is one of the long-term goals. To reach this goal, AI researchers have used various techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. The field of AI was founded in 1956 but went through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winter. After 2012, interest in AI drastically increased, followed by the AI boom in 2017-2022, where hundreds of billions of dollars were invested in the technology. The widespread use of AI has raised concerns about its potential risks and unintended consequences in the present and future, leading to discussions about regulatory policies.
