The technical paper provides a concise overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications. AI is a field of research in computer science that focuses on developing methods and software to enable machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions that achieve defined goals. Some examples of high-profile AI applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, and generative art. However, many cutting-edge AI has been integrated into general applications without being labeled as such. The subfields of AI research are centered around specific goals and tools, such as reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence, the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an equal level, is a long-term goal. To achieve this goal, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The field has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winter, but funding and interest increased after the success of deep learning in 2012 and the transformer architecture in 2017. The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
