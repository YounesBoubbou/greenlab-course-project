## Primary Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions

**Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**

* **Power generation:** 40%, primarily from coal and natural gas plants.
* **Transportation:** 24%, from vehicle exhaust.
* **Industrial processes:** 21%, including steelmaking, cement production, and chemical manufacturing.
* **Residential and commercial buildings:** 14%, from heating and cooling systems.


**Methane (CH4)**

* **Agriculture:** 37%, from livestock digestion and manure management.
* **Waste management:** 24%, from landfills and wastewater treatment plants.
* **Energy production:** 8%, from natural gas leaks and incomplete combustion.


**Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**

* **Agriculture:** 65%, from soil management and fertilizer use.
* **Waste management:** 20%, from anaerobic decomposition of organic matter.
* **Chemical production:** 15%, from industrial processes like nitric acid production.


**Variations Across Industries:**

**Energy:**

* Coal-fired power plants emit the highest CO2 per unit of energy produced.
* Natural gas and renewable energy sources emit less CO2.

**Transportation:**

* Vehicles using diesel fuel emit more CO2 than those using gasoline.
* Electric vehicles emit no tailpipe emissions.

**Agriculture:**

* Methane emissions from livestock are significant.
* Nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture are primarily due to fertilizer use.

**Waste Management:**

* Landfills emit methane, while composting and anaerobic digestion reduce methane production.

**Building and Manufacturing:**

* Emissions vary widely depending on the technology used for heating and cooling, building materials, and manufacturing processes.
