The technical paper summarizes artificial intelligence (AI) as a diverse field dedicated to creating machines capable of learning from their environment to achieve goals, often through methods like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, and perception. High-profile AI applications include advanced search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, strategy games analysis, but these are not always recognized as AI due to their ubiquity in daily life (known as the "AI winter"). Post 2012 deep learning breakthroughs have led to significant investments and growth ("the AI boom"), with transformer architectures further propelling this expansion. Despite its advancements, concerns about unintended consequences of widespread use are growing; hence regulatory discussions aimed at ensuring safe deployment without negating the benefits continue into contemporary times.
