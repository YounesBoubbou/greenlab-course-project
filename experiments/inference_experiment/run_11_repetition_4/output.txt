The provided technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science. AI is intelligence exhibited by machines that can perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. The paper highlights various AI applications, including search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools. It also notes that many AI applications are not perceived as AI, but rather as useful features in everyday products. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To achieve these goals, AI researchers have adapted various techniques from fields such as psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The paper also touches on the history of AI, including its founding in 1956 and periods of optimism and disappointment known as "AI winter."
