The paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), defining it as machine intelligence developed through computer systems. Key applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, voice interaction tools, autonomous vehicles, generative AI, and strategic game play. Traditional AI research focuses on goals like reasoning, learning, and perception, using techniques such as neural networks and formal logic. Founded in 1956, the field experienced optimism, disappointment (AI winters), and a significant resurgence since 2012 with deep learning advancements and transformer architectures. The early 21st century saw substantial investment, but also raised concerns about unintended consequences and long-term risks, prompting discussions on regulatory policies to ensure AI's safety and benefits.
