This paper provides a broad overview of artificial intelligence (AI), encompassing its definition, applications, history, and societal impact.

Key insights include:

- AI encompasses diverse techniques like search algorithms, logic, neural networks, and statistics to enable machines to learn and perform tasks.
- While prominent applications exist (e.g., search engines, self-driving cars), much AI technology has become integrated into everyday tools, blurring the line between AI and general functionality.
- The field has experienced periods of both excitement and disillusionment, with a recent surge in funding and development driven by breakthroughs like deep learning and transformer architectures.
- Widespread AI adoption raises concerns about unintended consequences and potential risks, necessitating discussions on regulatory policies to ensure responsible development and deployment.
