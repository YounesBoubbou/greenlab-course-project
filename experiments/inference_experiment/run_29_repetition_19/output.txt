 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. Applications range from web search engines to robotics, with some becoming commonplace without the "AI" label. AI research aims for general intelligence, using techniques like search, logic, neural networks, and statistics. Founded in 1956, AI has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment, with recent growth due to deep learning and transformer architectures. The widespread use of AI exposes unintended consequences and raises concerns about risks and future impacts, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
