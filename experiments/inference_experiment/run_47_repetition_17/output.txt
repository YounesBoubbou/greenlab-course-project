The technical paper provides a comprehensive overview on Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is the study of designing computer systems capable of perceiving their environment and using intelligence to take actions that maximize achieving defined goals. AI encompasses several subfields including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. The ultimate goal involves creating general intelligence similar to human abilities. Researchers have utilized various techniques such as search algorithms, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience in AI development. AI's history includes several cycles of optimism followed by disillusionment during periods known as AI winters; however, since 2017 with the advancement of transformer architecture, funding and interest have increased drastically. The widespread adoption of AI has led to unintended consequences and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions on regulatory policies for ensuring safety and benefits.
