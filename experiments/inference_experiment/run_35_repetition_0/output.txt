 AI is a field in computer science that develops machine intelligence to perceive environments and take actions. It's behind search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and more. The subfields focus on reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, language processing, perception, and robotics. The ultimate goal is general intelligence. Techniques include optimization, logic, neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI was established in 1956 but has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment. A resurgence began in 2012 with deep learning, leading to the current "AI boom." The use of AI raises concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and long-term effects, prompting discussions on regulatory policies.
