This paper provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI), which encompasses machines' capabilities for perception, learning, reasoning, and task completion aimed at maximizing defined goals—akin to human-level general intelligence. The field boasts numerous practical applications such as advanced search engines, recommendation systems, conversational AI like Google Assistant, autonomous vehicles from Waymo, generative creations (e.g., ChatGPT), and superhuman strategy game analysis exemplified by chess champions or Go masters. While some cutting-edge AI research seamlessly integrates into daily technology use without being recognized as such, the discipline's subfields focus on goals like knowledge representation and support for robotics with diverse techniques including mathematical optimization, logical reasoning methods borrowed from formal logic, artificial neural networks—and statistical approaches underpinned by economics or psychology. AI emerged in 1956; despite periodic funding droughts during 'AI winters,' a resurgence began post-2012 with deep learning and continued to grow after the transformer architecture advancements, culminating in significant investments by early 2020. However, its ubiquitous presence also brings unforeseen consequences prompting safety regulation discussions due to potential risks of AI misuse or harmful long-term impacts on society and individual lives as well as the environment. The paper underscores that while strides in AI research have been substantial, a balance between innovation and prudent oversight remains imperative for ensuring its benefits outweigh potential dangers to humanity's shared future.
