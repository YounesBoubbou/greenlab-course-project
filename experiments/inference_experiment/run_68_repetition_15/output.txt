21. Lithuania – Vilnius   
22. Luxembourg - Luxemburg City (and Bettembourg and Echternach) which holds the de facto status as capital because it hosts many EU institutions, but Brussels serves a more administrative role in international relations within Europe’s bureaucracy  
23. Malta – Valletta; this city became official after other capitals were moved for reasons like military threats or economic shifts   
24. Moldova - Chisinau, which is also the capital of a Transnistria region that has declared itself as an independent state but remains unrecognized by most countries

41. Ukraine – Kyiv (also has Lviv and other notable cities with rich cultural histories)    
42. United Kingdom - London, which is unique among European capitals for its global influence across multiple domains such as finance, culture, education etc; it also hosts the de facto seat of government through various institutions including Houses of Parliament located in Westminster  
43. Vatican City (an independent city-state within Italy) - Rome   
44. Andorra – and again its capital is Mariehamn due to unique political alliance with Åland Islands    

Europe's rich history has led many of these capitals through periods where they served as administrative, cultural or economic hubs beyond their official titles; some even hold multiple roles within various organizations such as the European Union. The interplay between national identities and international diplomacy continues to influence how we understand capital cities today in this diverse continent.
