Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of research that focuses on developing methods and software to enable machines to perceive their environment, learn from experience, and make decisions based on those learning.

Traditional AI goals include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence, the capability to perform any task at human level, remains a long-term goal.

AI researchers have adapted and integrated various techniques, such as search optimization, formal logic, neural networks, statistics, and operations research, to achieve these goals.

However, AI's widespread use in the 21st century has led to unintended consequences, harms, and concerns about its risks and long-term effects. This has prompted discussions about regulatory policies to ensure AI's safety and benefits.
