 The primary focus of artificial intelligence (AI) is creating computer systems with the ability to perform tasks that typically require human input, such as learning and problem-solving. AI encompasses various subfields like reasoning, natural language processing, and robotics, which are used to achieve specific goals. While some applications of AI are recognized as "AI," many have become part of our daily lives without being labeled as such. The field has experienced periods of optimism followed by setbacks, but funding and interest in AI increased significantly after deep learning was discovered. This led to the rapid growth of AI, with billions of dollars invested worldwide. However, this widespread use also brought unintended consequences and potential long-term risks. As a result, discussions about regulatory policies have arisen to ensure the safety and benefits of this technology.
