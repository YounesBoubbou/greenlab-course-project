As Europe is home to numerous countries, listing all their respective capital cities would be quite extensive. However, I can provide a concise overview for some major European nations and highlight a few unique cases:

1. **Albania** - Tirana
2. **Andorra** - Andorra la Vella
3. **Armenia** - Yerevan
4. **Austria** - Vienna
5. **Belarus** - Minsk
6. **Belgium** - Brussels (de facto capital; official EU and NATO headquarters)
7. **Bulgaria** - Sofia
8. **Croatia** - Zagreb
9. **Cyprus** - Nicosia (Northern Cyprus) /nicosia (recognized internationally by UN as the capital of the Republic of Cyprus)
10. **Czech Republic** - Prague
11. **Denmark** - Copenhagen
12. **Estonia** - Tallinn
13. **Finland** - Helsinki
14. **France** - Paris (most famous and largest European capital, also the de facto cultural center)
15. **Germany** - Berlin (since 1990)
16. **Greece** - Athens
17. **Hungary** - Budapest
18. **Ireland** - Dublin
19. **Italy** - Rome
20. **Kosovo** - Pristina

Note: Kosovo is not internationally recognized as a country, but it considers itself an independent state.

Due to the extensive number of European countries (50), including smaller and less frequently mentioned ones would exceed 300 words. Here are a few more:

21. **Latvia** - Riga
22. **Liechtenstein** - Vaduz
23. **Lithuania** - Vilnius
24. **Luxembourg** - Luxembourg City
25. **Malta** - Valletta

Continuing the list would take us beyond 300 words, but this provides a comprehensive overview of the capitals for some significant European countries.
