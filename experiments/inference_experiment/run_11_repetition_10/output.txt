The provided technical paper discusses the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment and take actions based on learning and intelligence. AI has various subfields centered around particular goals, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal is to achieve general intelligence, the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. The paper also touches on the history of AI, from its founding as an academic discipline in 1956 to the current AI boom, which has led to widespread investment and use of AI technology. However, this rapid growth has also exposed unintended consequences and harms, raising concerns about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of AI.
