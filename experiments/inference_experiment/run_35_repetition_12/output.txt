 The provided technical paper discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI), a computer science field that develops methods enabling machines to mimic human intelligence and achieve defined goals autonomously. High-profile AI applications range from search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, to superhuman game performance. While many cutting-edge AI applications have become commonplace and are no longer labeled as such, traditional AI research aims at reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics with the long-term goal of general intelligence. Research techniques include search, optimization, formal logic, neural networks, statistics, operations research, and economics. Since its inception in 1956, AI has experienced multiple cycles of enthusiasm followed by disappointments (AI winter). However, funding and interest skyrocketed after 2012 due to deep learning advancements, accelerating further with the transformer architecture. Today, billions of dollars are invested in AI (the AI boom). The widespread use of AI raises concerns about unintended consequences, harms, risks, and long-term effects, sparking discussions on regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
