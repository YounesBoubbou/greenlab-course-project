Climate change is fundamentally caused by greenhouse gas accumulation, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the principal contributor primarily due to the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. This process releases CO2 into the atmosphere. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), though present in smaller quantities, contribute significantly to global warming.

A primary source of these emissions is the energy sector - both power generation and industrial processes that rely on fossil fuels for operation. In this context, combustion of coal for electricity production, oil refining activities, and natural gas extraction are significant contributors to CO2 emissions.

Transportation is another major sector where greenhouse gases are emitted predominantly from cars, trucks, buses, aircraft, and ships that use fossil fuels as their primary energy source. In the aviation industry alone, while accounting for a smaller percentage of global GHG emissions compared to other sectors, it has been increasing at an alarming rate due to rapid growth in air travel.

The industrial sector contributes through activities like cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical synthesis processes that involve large quantities of fossil fuels. Agricultural practices also contribute notably; livestock farming generates methane as a byproduct of animal digestion and manure management while rice cultivation releases N2O due to anaerobic conditions created during paddy irrigation.

Lastly, land use change activities like deforestation are significant contributors since trees absorb CO2. When forests are cut down or burned for other uses such as agriculture or urban expansion, the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere.

Thus, while energy production and consumption dominate in driving these emissions, various sectors including transportation, industry, agriculture, and land use management all play crucial roles contributing to greenhouse gas emission levels across different countries. Understanding these sources allows for targeted interventions aimed at mitigating climate change through policy changes, technological innovations, and sustainable practices.
