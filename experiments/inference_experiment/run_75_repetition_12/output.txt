## Primary Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions:

**Carbon Dioxide:**

* **Energy production:** Power plants, coal-fired heating, transportation
* **Industrial processes:** Manufacturing, steel production, cement production
* **Agriculture:** Livestock farming, agricultural practices (fertilizers)
* **Residential and commercial buildings:** Heating and cooling systems, appliances

**Methane:**

* **Waste management:** Landfill decomposition, sewage treatment
* **Agriculture:** Enteric fermentation in livestock, manure management
* **Energy production:** Natural gas leaks and production
* **Agriculture:** Rice cultivation

**Nitrous Oxide:**

* **Agriculture:** Soil management practices, fertilizer use
* **Waste management:** Wastewater treatment
* **Transportation:** Emissions from vehicles
* **Chemical manufacturing:** Production of nitric acid and other fertilizers


**Variations Across Industries:**

**Energy production:**
* High emissions of carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants and natural gas power plants.
* Renewable energy sources emit little to no greenhouse gases.

**Transportation:**
* Majority of emissions come from gasoline and diesel vehicles.
* Electric vehicles and public transport emit little to no greenhouse gases.

**Manufacturing:**
* Emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from industrial processes like steel production and chemical manufacturing.
* Implementation of energy efficiency measures can reduce emissions.

**Agriculture:**
* Emissions of methane from livestock and nitrous oxide from soil management practices.
* Sustainable agricultural practices can mitigate emissions.

**Waste management:**
* Emissions of methane from landfills and nitrous oxide from wastewater treatment.
* Implementing composting and anaerobic digestion can reduce methane emissions.
