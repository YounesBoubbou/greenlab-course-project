 The provided technical paper discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI), a computer science field focused on developing machines with learning capabilities to achieve defined goals, such as web search engines, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. AI research encompasses areas like reasoning, knowledge representation, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal is general intelligence, enabling machines to perform any human task at least equally well. Techniques used include search algorithms, formal logic, neural networks, and methods based on statistics and economics. AI's history includes cycles of optimism followed by periods of reduced funding (AI winter), but a surge in interest and investment since 2012 due to advancements in deep learning and transformer architectures. However, the widespread use of AI has revealed unintended consequences and raised concerns about future risks, prompting discussions on regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
