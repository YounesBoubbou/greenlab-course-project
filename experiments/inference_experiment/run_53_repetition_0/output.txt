Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field within computer science that focuses on developing systems capable of perceiving environments, learning, and taking actions towards defined goals. Key applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and game analysis. AI research encompasses subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. Since its inception in 1956, the field has experienced multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment due to funding fluctuations known as "AI winter." Recent advancements, particularly with deep learning and transformer architectures, have sparked a significant AI boom, generating hundreds of billions of dollars in investment. However, widespread use has also highlighted unintended consequences and risks, leading to discussions about regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
