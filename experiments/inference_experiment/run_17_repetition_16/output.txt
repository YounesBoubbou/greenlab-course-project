The technical paper discusses artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to achieve defined goals. AI has various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of AI is general intelligence, where machines can complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. To reach this goal, researchers have adapted techniques from search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and statistics. Despite periods of disappointment (AI winters), the field experienced significant growth after 2012 with the advent of deep learning and the transformer architecture. This growth has led to concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and risks associated with AI's widespread use in the present and future.
