The provided technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science. AI enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve defined goals. The paper highlights various subfields of AI research, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal is general intelligence, the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. To reach this goal, researchers have adapted and integrated techniques from various fields. The field has experienced multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, but funding and interest increased after 2012 with the advent of deep learning and transformer architecture. Today, AI is widely used, exposing unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
