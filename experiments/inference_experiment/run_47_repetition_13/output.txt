Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses intelligence demonstrated by machines, particularly computer systems. It involves developing methods and software for computers to perceive their environment using learning and intelligence, thereby making decisions that optimize goal achievement. Key applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, human speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and superhuman game analysis. AI techniques consist of search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistical methods, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, among others. The field was established in 1956 with periodic cycles of optimism followed by disappointment, known as AI winters. Increased funding and interest from 2012 due to deep learning advancements propelled the growth further after 2017's transformer architecture breakthrough. By the early 2020s, AI investments reached hundreds of billions of dollars, indicating the AI boom. However, its widespread use revealed unintended consequences, harms, and future risks concerning safety and benefits, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
