 This technical paper discusses the broad definition of artificial intelligence (AI) as intelligent machines that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals. AI has various applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. However, many of these applications are not labeled as AI because they have become ubiquitous. AI research is focused on achieving general intelligence, which involves tasks that humans can perform on an equal or better level. Researchers use a variety of techniques like search algorithms, neural networks, formal logic, and optimization to achieve their goals. The field has experienced periods of optimism and disappointment with funding levels, but in recent years has seen significant growth due to deep learning. However, the widespread adoption of AI also raises concerns about unintended consequences and long-term effects that require regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
