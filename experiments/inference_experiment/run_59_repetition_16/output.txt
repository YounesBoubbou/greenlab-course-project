 Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field that focuses on developing machines with the ability to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to achieve goals. Some high-profile applications include search engines, recommendation systems, human speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategy games. The traditional AI research fields are reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence is a long-term goal of AI research, which aims to create machines that can complete tasks at least as well as humans. To achieve this, AI researchers use a wide range of techniques, including search algorithms, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The field has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, with funding and interest increasing after deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques in 2012. AI's widespread use also raised concerns about its potential consequences and risks, leading to discussions about regulatory policies for safety and benefits.
