The Industrial Revolution ushered an era dominated by mechanization, factories, urban growth, and a shift towards fossil fuels like coal and oil—the cornerstone for modern economies but with substantial environmental repercussions. The burning of these non-renewable resources released copious amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), into the atmosphere, aggravating global warming significantly over time.

In response to escalating climate change concerns and their associated threats—rising sea levels due to melting ice caps, extreme weather events becoming more frequent and severe, biodiversity loss from changing habitats, among others—international efforts have emerged as a pivotal force in mobilizing action. The Kyoto Protocol of 1997 was one landmark attempt; it legally bound developed nations to emission reduction targets while allowing developing countries certain flexibilities due to their different economic contexts and stages of industrialization, under the principle that those who have historically contributed more to GHG emissions bear greater responsibility.

The Paris Agreement further built upon these efforts in 2015 by engaging a broader array of nations through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—a country-specific action plan targeting climate change mitigation, adaptation strategies and financial flows to support the process.

These international agreements spurred economic realignment towards sustainability by encouraging investment in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectricity which not only provide cleaner alternatives but have also become cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels due to advancements and economies of scale.

Technologically, this period has seen significant strides—development and implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies that aim at capturing CO2 emissions directly from industrial sources or power plants before they reach the atmosphere; energy efficiency improvements across multiple sectors through smart grids and demand-side management strategies.

Innovations in electric vehicle technology are reducing dependency on oil, with numerous countries expanding public transportation networks to decrease private car usage—a major source of urban GHG emissions. Additionally, advancements such as vertical farming within cities help reduce the carbon footprint associated with long-distance food supply chains by enabling localized and sustainable agricultural practices in dense metropolitan areas where space is scarce but resources are abundant through technologies like hydroponics or aeroponics.

Researchers continue to innovate biotechnology for more resilient crops, able to withstand extreme weather patterns linked directly to climate change—essential knowledge transfer can help developing countries leapfrog towards sustainable agriculture without repeating environmentally harmful practices of the past industrial era.

At a corporate level, industries are increasingly adopting circular economy models that prioritize reusing materials and reducing waste in production processes while consumer choices too shift—evidenced by growing demand for products labeled as 'green' or having lower carbon footprints due to societal awareness.

Collectively these measures, grounded economically with the creation of green jobs within new industries yet advanced technologically through innovation and international cooperation reflect a concerted effort against climate change—a testament that while industrialization was once synonymous with environmental degradation, today’s society is gradually redefining it as an era promoting balance between economic growth, societal well-being, and ecological sustainability.
