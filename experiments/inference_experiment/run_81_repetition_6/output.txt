Greenhouse gas emissions stem from diverse sources, varying significantly across industries.

**Carbon dioxide (CO2),** the dominant contributor, primarily originates from:

* **Electricity & Heat Production:** Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for power generation accounts for a large share of global CO2 emissions. 
* **Transportation:** Cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes fueled by gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel release substantial amounts of CO2.
* **Industry:** Manufacturing processes, cement production, and steelmaking utilize fossil fuels, generating significant CO2 emissions.

**Methane (CH4)**, a potent greenhouse gas, is primarily emitted from:

* **Agriculture:** Livestock rearing (especially cattle) produces methane through digestion, and rice cultivation releases it during fermentation.
* **Natural Gas & Oil:** Leakage during extraction, processing, and transportation contributes to methane emissions.
* **Waste Management:** Decomposing organic waste in landfills generates methane.

**Nitrous oxide (N2O)** emissions arise from:

* **Agriculture:** Fertilizers containing nitrogen release N2O during application and breakdown in soils.
* **Industrial Processes:** Production of nitric acid and adipic acid releases nitrous oxide as a byproduct.


Addressing these sources through technological advancements, policy interventions, and behavioral changes is crucial to mitigating climate change.
