Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have grown significantly due to technological advancements and decreasing costs. However, their intermittency poses a challenge for energy systems, requiring the development of energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers use incentives such as tax credits and feed-in tariffs to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach incorporating energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
