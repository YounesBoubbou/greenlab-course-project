Artificial intelligence (AI) involves developing computer systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence, such as learning, perception, and decision-making. Key applications include search engines, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools like ChatGPT. AI encompasses various subfields aimed at achieving goals like reasoning, natural language processing, and robotics. Since its founding in 1956, AI has experienced multiple booms and winters; it saw significant growth after 2012 with deep learning and further accelerated with the transformer architecture by 2020. Currently, AI's widespread use poses risks and unintended consequences, prompting discussions on regulation to ensure safety and benefits.
