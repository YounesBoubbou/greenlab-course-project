Renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, have experienced rapid growth due to technological advancements and declining costs. However, their intermittent nature requires storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers incentivize the transition through measures like tax credits and feed-in tariffs. Achieving carbon neutrality demands a holistic approach encompassing energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and international cooperation.
