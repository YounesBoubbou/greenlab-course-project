The paper provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI), defining it as intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. The author highlights various applications of AI, including web search engines, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. They also discuss the long-term goals of AI research, such as general intelligence, and the techniques used to achieve these goals, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The paper also examines the history of AI, noting cycles of optimism followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Finally, the author discusses the unintended consequences and harms of widespread AI use in the 21st century and the need for regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits of the technology.
