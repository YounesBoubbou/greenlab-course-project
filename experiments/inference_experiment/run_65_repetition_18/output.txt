This technical paper delves into the evolution, applications, goals, tools, interdisciplinary influences, funding history, impact, unintended consequences, societal concerns, regulations, and transformative innovations of artificial intelligence (AI) since its inception as an academic discipline. It highlights AI's diverse subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, natural language processing among others aimed at replicating human-like capabilities through advanced algorithms such as deep learning and the Transformer architecture. The paper further outlines how pervasive integration of AI has blurred its identification with specific tasks leading to common usage in various platforms without explicit labeling as AI, indicating societal acceptance when technology becomes indispensable. Despite early hype cycles known as 'AI winters', the field witnessed a resurgence post-2012 due to deep learning advancements and later with transformer architecture further catalyzed by significant investments in recent years which led to an AI boom, underscoring its substantial economic impact. Nonetheless, this exponential growth brought forth unintended negative outcomes like job displacement concerns alongside benefits leading society towards debates on regulations for safeguarding against future risks and promoting sustainable progress in the era of pervasive AI deployment across sectors including healthcare, autonomous vehicles, entertainment among others.
