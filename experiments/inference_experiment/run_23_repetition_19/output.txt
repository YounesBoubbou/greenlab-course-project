The provided technical paper provides a broad overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various applications. AI is defined as machines that perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve goals. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics, with general intelligence being a long-term goal. To reach these goals, AI researchers use a range of techniques such as search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and statistical methods, among others. The field has experienced multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment and loss of funding until the recent growth in interest and investment after 2012 with deep learning and the transformer architecture. This growth led to concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and risks associated with AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
