Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses machine-based intelligence that can learn from experience and adapt actions based on goals. AI applications include search engines like Google, recommendation systems, virtual assistants like Siri, autonomous vehicles such as Waymo, generative tools like ChatGPT, and AI-driven strategy games players for chess and Go. The field aims to achieve general intelligence equivalent to human performance across various tasks through reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics, with a long-term goal including AI that can match or surpass human intelligence.

A wide range of techniques is used in AI research, incorporating search algorithms, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistical methods, operations research, and economics. These tools have been integrated over time as the field progressed through various cycles of development and setbacks, with significant growth after breakthroughs like deep learning and the introduction of the transformer architecture around 2017.

Investments in AI reached hundreds of billions of dollars by the early 2020s as the technology became more prevalent. However, this expansion has also raised concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and potential future impacts on society. As a result, discussions are ongoing about regulatory policies to ensure that AI benefits humanity while mitigating its negative effects.
