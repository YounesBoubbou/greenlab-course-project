Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses machine intelligence exhibited through computer systems that perceive their environment, learn from data, and take actions towards goal attainment. AI applications include search engines like Google, recommendation platforms such as Amazon and Netflix, interactive speech systems, autonomous vehicles like Waymo, generative tools like ChatGPT, and superhuman gaming capabilities. The field's core goals are reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. General intelligence aiming for human-equivalent performance is among the long-term objectives.

AI employs various techniques like search, optimization, logic, neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, integrating knowledge from diverse fields. AI was established in 1956 and experienced multiple cycles of optimism followed by setbacks (AI winters) until deep learning surpassed previous methods in 2012, which led to increased funding post-2017 with the advent of the transformer architecture.

As AI spread widely over the first decade of the 21st century, it exposed unintended consequences and risks. These have sparked discussions on regulatory policies for ensuring safety and benefits while addressing potential harms in both current use and future implications. Despite challenges, AI investments reached hundreds of billions by the early 2020s, reflecting its significant impact and ongoing development.
