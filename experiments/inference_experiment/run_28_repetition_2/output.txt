 Renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind power, are key to combatting climate change due to technological advancements and cost reductions. However, their intermittency requires energy storage solutions and grid integration strategies. Policymakers use incentives to accelerate the transition but achieving carbon neutrality necessitates a holistic approach including energy efficiency, infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
