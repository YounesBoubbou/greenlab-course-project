The technical paper provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI), defining it as machine intelligence that enables perception, learning, and action for achieving goals. Key applications include search engines, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools like ChatGPT. AI research focuses on subfields such as reasoning, knowledge representation, and natural language processing. The discipline has seen cycles of optimism and disappointment, with a resurgence driven by deep learning and transformer architectures since 2012. This boom has attracted significant investment but also raised concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and risks, prompting discussions on regulatory policies to ensure AI safety and benefits.
