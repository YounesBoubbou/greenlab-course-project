The technical paper summarizes artificial intelligence (AI) as a multifaceted computer science discipline that develops algorithms for machines performing tasks requiring reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, and robotics. AI's applications span web search engines like Google Search to sophisticated domains such as autonomous vehicles with Waymo; creative tools exemplified by ChatGPT and AI artwork creation, alongside strategic game analysis in chess or Go played at superhuman levels using deep learning techniques which have surged since 2012. Despite its integration into everyday technologies often without explicit labeling as "AI," the field has experienced cycles of funding fluctuations known as AI winters and booms, respectively. The recent growth in interest and investment underscores a critical examination of unintended consequences stemming from widespread useâ€”including ethical considerations around bias, privacy concerns, economic displacement risks, societal impact changes such as job automation, surveillance issues raising civil liberties questions, misinformation spreading potentiality through AI systems like deepfakes. These challenges have ignited discussions on regulatory measures to ensure the benefits of AI technologies are balanced against their long-term implications for safety and societal wellbeing.
