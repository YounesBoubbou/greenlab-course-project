 I'm here to help you out with factual information, but providing the exact capital city for all European countries within a strict 300-word limit is quite challenging. However, I can certainly provide you with a list of European countries and their capitals in an abridged format.

Here are the capitals of most European countries:
1. Albania - Tirana
2. Andorra - Andorra la Vella (co-capital with the city of Escaldes-Engordany)
3. Austria - Vienna
4. Belarus - Minsk
5. Belgium - Brussels
6. Bosnia and Herzegovina - Sarajevo (official capital), Banja Luka (de facto capital of the Republika Srpska entity)
7. Bulgaria - Sofia
8. Croatia - Zagreb
9. Cyprus - Nicosia
10. Czech Republic - Prague
11. Denmark - Copenhagen
12. Estonia - Tallinn
13. Finland - Helsinki
14. France - Paris
15. Germany - Berlin (official seat), Bonn (historical seat)
16. Greece - Athens
17. Hungary - Budapest
18. Iceland - Reykjavik
19. Ireland - Dublin
20. Italy - Rome
21. Kosovo - Pristina (declared capital, not recognized by all countries)
22. Latvia - Riga
23. Liechtenstein - Vaduz
24. Lithuania - Vilnius
25. Luxembourg - Luxembourg City
26. Malta - Valletta
27. Moldova - Chișinău
28. Monaco - Monaco (city)

43. Switzerland - Bern (federal capital), Zürich (largest city) and Geneva (seat of some international organizations)
44. Ukraine - Kiev
45. United Kingdom - London (de facto), Edinburgh (historical) and Cardiff (administrative)

There are a few exceptions to this list, such as Kosovo's capital Pristina, which is not recognized as the capital by all countries. Additionally, some countries like Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom have multiple significant cities that serve various functions in their governments. This summary should give you a good starting point for understanding the capitals of European countries.
