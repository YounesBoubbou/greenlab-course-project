Climate change is primarily driven by an increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The largest source of these emissions globally comes from the burning of fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and industry processes.

Carbon dioxide is produced in significant amounts by coal-fired power plants, which accounted for about 37% of global carbon emissions as of recent years, followed closely by oil (29%) and natural gas industries combined with other energy production sectors at around 18%. Within these percentages lies the transportation industry's contribution through petroleum combustion in vehicles – primarily cars, trucks, planes, ships, trains. Industrial processes are another substantial source of carbon emissions due to their reliance on fossil fuels for energy and as raw materials or feedstock; this sector is often broken down into manufacturing (approximately 13%), construction activities like cement production (8% directly contributing CO2, plus indirectly through the use phase where concrete structures release stored CO2 upon weathering) – making it a significant source.

Methane emissions arise mainly from agriculture and waste management practices due to enteric fermentation in ruminants like cows, rice paddies which produce methane during anaerobic decomposition of organic matter (about 40%), coal mining activities including ventilation for safety that releases trapped gas directly into the atmosphere, and natural sources such as wetlands. The energy sector is also a notable source due to leaks in oil and gas extraction processes which can be quite large when facilities are poorly managed or maintained; these unintentional methane emissions have been estimated at about 5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases recently, but efforts like leak detection technologies aim to reduce this.

Nitrous oxide is mostly released from agricultural soils due to the application and runoff of nitrogen-containing fertilizers (estimated around 60%), industrial activities such as production of nitric acid, combustion processes in power plants operating on coal or biomass which can account for up to 15%, while natural sources like soils also contribute a smaller percentage.

To mitigate climate change impacts effectively, addressing these primary sectors is crucial by reducing emissions at their root causes through energy efficiency improvements, transitioning toward renewable energy in power production and transportation, adopting sustainable agricultural practices to minimize methane release from livest0ods and rice cultivation while capturing carbon when feasible.
