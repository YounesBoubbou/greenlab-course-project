The technical paper highlights that artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses machine or computer systems capable of tasks traditionally requiring human intellect, such as web search optimization, recommendation engines, voice interaction interfaces like Siri and Alexa, autonomous driving technology from Waymo, generative AI tools including ChatGPT for creative outputs, and superhuman gameplay in strategies games. Many applications blend into daily life seamlessly without being recognized specifically as advanced AI technologies due to their ubiquity and utility. The field of AI research targets various goals like general intelligence replication or specific tasks enhancement using different methods including but not limited to logical reasoning, machine learning (deep neural networks), optimization algorithms, natural language processing, robotics support systems among others—drawing from diverse disciplines for integration into their development process.

Historically marked by cycles of high expectations and subsequent disappointments known as AI winters since its inception at the Dartmouth College Conference in 1956, recent developments around deep learning (post-2012) have rejuvenated interest leading to a significant investment surge dubbed an 'AI boom'. Concurrently with this explosion of AI applications comes concerns about unintended harms and future risks. These challenges are prompting serious consideration for regulatory measures, aimed at maintaining the safety benefits while mitigating potential negatives arising from widespread usage in contemporary society—which include ethical implications like privacy issues or algorithmic bias concerns linked with AI systems' decisions and actions.
