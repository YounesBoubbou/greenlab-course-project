Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most significant contributor. The main source of CO2 emissions is fossil fuel combustion, which includes the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2019, fossil fuels accounted for approximately 85% of CO2 emissions worldwide.

Other significant sources of GHGs include land use changes, such as deforestation and land conversion for agriculture or urbanization, which contribute to about 15% of total emissions. Additionally, the production and use of agricultural practices like livestock farming and rice cultivation also emit large amounts of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), both potent GHGs.

The industries that contribute the most to GHG emissions vary depending on the specific gas and the source of data. However, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the following are some of the main industrial sectors responsible for GHG emissions:

1. Energy production and distribution: This sector is the largest contributor to CO2 emissions, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation, heating, and transportation.
2. Industrial processes: Industries such as cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical synthesis emit significant amounts of GHGs through various industrial processes.
3. Transportation: The transportation sector is a major source of CO2 emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels for road, air, and sea transportation.
4. Agriculture: Agricultural activities like livestock farming, rice cultivation, and fertilizer use lead to significant methane and N2O emissions.
5. Waste management: Landfills and waste incineration are significant sources of methane emissions due to the decomposition of organic waste in these environments.

Understanding the primary sources of GHG emissions from different industries is crucial for developing effective strategies to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. By identifying the sectors responsible for the most significant emissions, policymakers can develop targeted policies to promote clean energy transitions, improve industrial processes, and encourage more sustainable transportation practices.
