The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal of AI research is to achieve general intelligence, or the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an equal level. The paper highlights the adaptation and integration of various techniques, such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The history of AI includes multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winter, but recent advancements in deep learning have led to a significant increase in funding and interest. However, the widespread use of AI has also exposed several unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
