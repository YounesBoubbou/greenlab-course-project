Greenhouse gas emissions originate from various human activities across diverse industries.  

**Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**, the most prevalent greenhouse gas, stems primarily from:

* **Electricity and Heat Production:** Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) in power plants for electricity generation is a major source. 
* **Transportation:** Cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes rely heavily on fossil fuels, releasing substantial CO₂ emissions.
* **Industry:** Manufacturing processes often use fossil fuels for energy and create CO₂ as a byproduct. Cement production is particularly carbon-intensive.

**Methane (CH₄)**, a potent greenhouse gas, comes from:

* **Agriculture:** Livestock farming (particularly cattle) releases methane through digestion. Rice paddies also contribute to methane emissions.
* **Natural Gas Production and Distribution:** Leaks during extraction, processing, and transportation of natural gas release methane into the atmosphere.
* **Waste Management:** Decomposing organic waste in landfills generates methane.

**Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)** is emitted from:

* **Agriculture:** Fertilizers used in agriculture are a significant source of N₂O emissions.
* **Industrial Processes:** Certain industrial activities, such as production of nitric acid and nylon, release nitrous oxide.


Understanding these emission sources across industries is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate climate change.
