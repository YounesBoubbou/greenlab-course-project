The provided technical paper on Artificial Intelligence (AI) highlights the field's evolution, goals, and applications. AI is a subfield of computer science that develops methods for machines to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. Traditional AI research focuses on reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal is general intelligence, the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level. Techniques adapted and integrated into AI include search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. The field experienced multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment before the 2012 deep learning breakthrough, which led to a surge in funding and interest. The paper also touches on unintended consequences, harms, and risks associated with AI's widespread use, prompting discussions about regulatory policies for its safe and beneficial development.
