Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses machine intelligence that can perform tasks requiring human-like perception, learning, decision-making, and action. Key applications include search engines, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools like ChatGPT. AI research focuses on subfields such as reasoning, planning, and natural language processing, with goals ranging from practical tools to general intelligence. While facing cycles of optimism and disappointment (AI winters), recent advancements in deep learning and the transformer architecture have sparked a boom in AI investment since 2017. However, widespread use has raised concerns about unintended consequences and long-term risks, leading to discussions on regulatory policies for ethical and safe AI development.
