AI is defined as machine intelligence or computer science that enables systems to perceive their surroundings, learn through data, and take actions that optimize their chances of achieving set goals. Key AI applications include web search engines (Google), recommendation platforms (Netflix), voice assistants (Siri), self-driving cars (Waymo), generative tools (ChatGPT), and high-level gaming strategies (chess, Go). As AI has advanced, many applications have become so common they're no longer labeled as AI. AI goals encompass reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. General intelligence, or the ability to perform human tasks at least as well, is among long-term objectives.

AI techniques include search optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, and economics. It draws from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other disciplines. The field started in 1956 with optimism followed by AI winters due to funding shortages. However, growth was reinvigorated around 2017 with the transformer architecture's introduction.

Widespread use of AI in recent years has revealed unintended consequences and potential harms, leading to discussions about regulatory policies to ensure technology safety and benefits. In early 2020s, investment in AI reached hundreds of billions of dollars as the tech sector boomed.
