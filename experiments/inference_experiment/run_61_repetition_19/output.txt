The Industrial Revolution not only propelled humanity into modern society but also set forth mechanisms contributing massively towards anthropogenenic global warming through elevated greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. This period of rapid industrial growth and technological progress came with a steep environmental cost that the world began to grapple with in the late 20th century, manifesting as an increasingly urgent call for action against climate change.

In response to this global crisis, several international agreements have been enacted, such as the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and more recently the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 by almost every nation on Earth at COP-21 summit held in France. The primary goal behind these protocols was to combat climate change through significant reductions in carbon emissions, which nations committed to achieving via various targets set within their National Determined Contributions (NDCs).

Beyond policy frameworks and international cooperation lies a series of economic and technological advancements aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects on our environment. One such evolution is seen in renewable energy sector development, particularly wind power technology which has undergone significant improvements over time with increased efficiency rates due to better turbine designs enabling economies of scale; solar photovoltaic cells have also experienced exponential growth driven by decreasing manufacturing costs and heightened efficiencies.

Simultaneously, the advent of smart grid technologies facilitates efficient energy distribution while allowing for consumer-level participation in sustainable practices through demand response programs—incentivizing reduced consumption during peak hours or when alternative green sources are scarce. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is another avenue being pursued to directly reduce CO2 emissions from industrial sites by capturing carbon dioxide at its emission point before it reaches the atmosphere, then sequestering them deep underground within geological formations or utilizing in enhanced oil recovery processes.

Furthermore, energy efficiency advancements across multiple industries—from transportation with electric vehicles to buildings via improved insulation materials and designs—have substantially reduced carbon footprints while lowering operational costs through resource conservation. Additionally, the transition towards circular economies in which resources are recycled or reused minimizes waste generation along with emissions associated thereof by extending product lifecycles and fostering sustainable practices within production processes; these efforts not only contribute to climate change mitigation but also stimulate job creation through new markets for green products.

In summary, the response towards reducing anthropogenic global warming stems from both policy frameworks backed by international cooperation as well as economic and technological developments that aim at decoupling growth from environmental degradation; together they offer promising pathways forward in our collective efforts to combat climate change.
