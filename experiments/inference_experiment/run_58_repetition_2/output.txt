 Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power have grown due to decreasing costs. However, their intermittent nature poses challenges for energy systems, requiring storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers offer incentives such as tax credits and feed-in tariffs to promote the transition. Achieving carbon neutrality demands a holistic approach that includes energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
