The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), vary significantly across different industries. In the energy sector, which is the largest contributor to CO₂ emissions, fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation and transportation accounts for a significant portion. The burning of coal releases the most CO₂ per unit of energy produced compared to natural gas or oil.

In agriculture, methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) are major contributors due to livestock farming and manure management, as well as fertiliser use in crop production. Livestock emit CH₄ through enteric fermentation during digestion, while N₂O is released from soil after the application of nitrogen-based fertilisers.

Forestry activities can both mitigate and exacerbate emissions depending on their practices. Deforestation releases CO₂ stored in trees into the atmosphere, whereas afforestation and reforestation projects can sequester carbon dioxide and reduce overall emissions.

Industry also plays a significant role, with emissions primarily originating from fuel combustion for energy use, as well as industrial processes that release greenhouse gases like N₂O during production of chemicals, metals, and other materials.

Buildings contribute to emissions through their operational energy use (heating, cooling, lighting) and the embodied carbon in construction materials. Transportation is another critical sector, with CO₂ emissions from passenger vehicles and heavy goods transport being substantial contributors.

Understanding these sources is crucial for developing targeted mitigation strategies across different industries to combat climate change effectively.
