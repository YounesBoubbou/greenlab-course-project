Renewable energy sources, specifically solar and wind power, are key components of global strategies to address climate change. Technological advancements and decreasing costs have led to their growth. However, their intermittency presents challenges that require energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers use incentives to accelerate transition, but achieving carbon neutrality needs a holistic approach incorporating energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration.
