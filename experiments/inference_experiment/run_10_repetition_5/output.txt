The adoption of renewable energy sources (solar and wind power) has grown significantly due to technological advancements and decreasing costs. However, intermittency poses challenges for energy systems, requiring energy storage and grid integration solutions. Policymakers have implemented incentives, but achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach and international collaboration.
