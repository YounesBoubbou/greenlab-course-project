The Industrial Revolution's legacy continues to influence contemporary society, with far-reaching consequences on economies, societies, and the environment. The subsequent rise in greenhouse gas emissions has contributed significantly to global warming, prompting international efforts to address this pressing issue. Notably, the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and Paris Agreement (2015) have served as pivotal milestones in promoting collective action to mitigate climate change.

As a response to climate change, significant economic advancements have emerged. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels, driving investments in clean technologies. The growth of green finance has also facilitated the mobilization of capital for climate-resilient infrastructure and low-carbon projects. For instance, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that renewable energy could provide up to 50% of global electricity by 2050.

Technological innovations have been a key driver in this transition. Advances in energy storage, such as battery technologies, have improved the efficiency and affordability of renewable power generation. Additionally, the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a promising solution for reducing emissions from industrial processes. Furthermore, the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) has accelerated the adoption of low-carbon transportation options.

In conclusion, the economic and technological advancements that have emerged in response to climate change reflect a significant shift towards a more sustainable future. As international cooperation continues to drive innovation and investment in clean technologies, it is likely that greenhouse gas emissions will decrease, mitigating the worst impacts of global warming. However, continued efforts are needed to accelerate this transition, particularly in the context of transitioning from fossil fuel-based economies to low-carbon models.
