The Industrial Revolution's legacy has been significant for multiple aspects of human civilization; one critical effect being increased greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global warming. In order to mitigate this crisis, numerous international initiatives like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement have been implemented by nations worldwide to tackle climate change.

Economically speaking, several sectors have undergone transformations as part of these efforts:

1) Renewable Energy: The shift towards cleaner energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectricity, geothermal, and biomass has become more pronounced. As per data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable sources accounted for 72% of global power capacity additions in 2019.

2) Electric Vehicles: The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) represents a significant shift away from fossil fuels and towards low-emission transportation alternatives. According to Bloomberg NEF, EV sales could grow to more than half of all new car sales by the end of this decade if current policies are maintained.

3) Energy Efficiency Standards: Governments worldwide are implementing stringent energy efficiency standards for various appliances like refrigerators, lighting, and HVAC systems. These measures aim at reducing overall energy consumption in homes and industries.

4) Sustainable Agriculture & Forestry: Initiatives focusing on sustainable farming practices, precision agriculture technologies, and reforestation efforts have gained traction as part of climate change mitigation strategies. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that sustainable agriculture could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 25% by the year 2030.

On the technological front:

1) Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS): Research on capturing carbon dioxide from industrial processes for storage is advancing rapidly. Companies like Climeworks and Carbios are leading in this field, with plans to scale up these technologies over time.

2) Clean Energy Innovation: The development of new clean energy technologies is being driven by private enterprises and research institutions alike. For example, companies like Tesla have pioneered advancements in battery technology for electric vehicles and energy storage solutions.

3) Smart Grids & Renewable Integration: Advanced grid management systems are enabling the integration of intermittent renewable sources into power networks effectively. This includes demand response programs that help balance supply and demand during peak times while minimizing carbon emissions.

4) Sustainable Urban Planning: Cities are transitioning to more eco-friendly designs through green spaces, walkability, public transportation enhancements, and smart city technologies that optimize resource usage.

In conclusion, the economic and technological advancements stemming from global efforts to combat climate change have been multifaceted. These include shifts towards renewable energy sources, improvements in vehicle technology, stringent efficiency standards, sustainable agriculture practices, innovative carbon capture techniques, development of new clean energy technologies, advanced grid management systems for renewable integration, sustainable urban planning initiatives, among others. These transformative changes are not only crucial for addressing climate change but also have the potential to drive economic growth and societal progress towards a more sustainable future.
