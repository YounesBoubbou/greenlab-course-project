 Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field that deals with creating computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision making, and learning from experience. AI has many practical applications, including web search engines, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. However, the term "artificial intelligence" can be misleading because it implies that machines are capable of true artificial consciousness or general intelligence, which is still a long-term goal for researchers. Despite its limitations, AI has been rapidly advancing in recent years, thanks to breakthroughs like deep learning and transformers, leading to an "AI boom" in investment and adoption. However, as AI becomes more pervasive, it also raises concerns about unintended consequences and risks, such as job displacement, bias, and privacy violations, which require regulation and ethical considerations.
