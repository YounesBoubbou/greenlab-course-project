 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment and take actions based on learned intelligence to achieve defined goals. Applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategy games. AI research aims for general intelligence but uses various techniques such as optimization, logic, neural networks, statistics, operations research, and economics. AI was founded in 1956 with cycles of optimism and disappointment, seeing a resurgence since 2012 with deep learning and transformer architecture. However, concerns over unintended consequences and risks have led to discussions about regulatory policies. Traditional goals include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics support. AI integration into general applications sometimes goes unnoticed.
