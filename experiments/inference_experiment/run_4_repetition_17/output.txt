 Adopting renewable energy sources is crucial for combating climate change, with solar and wind power growing due to tech advancements and decreasing costs. However, intermittency poses challenges for energy systems, requiring storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers have implemented incentives, but a holistic approach incorporating energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration is needed to achieve carbon neutrality.
