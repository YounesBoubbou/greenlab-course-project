The technical paper provides a concise overview of artificial intelligence (AI), including its definition, applications, subfields, and long-term goals. The paper highlights that AI has integrated techniques from various fields such as search, mathematical optimization, neural networks, psychology, and more. AI went through cycles of optimism and disappointment, with funding and interest increasing after 2012 due to deep learning's success. It also notes the growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, leading to billions of dollars being invested in AI. The paper discusses the unintended consequences and harms of AI use and raises concerns about its future risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions on regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
