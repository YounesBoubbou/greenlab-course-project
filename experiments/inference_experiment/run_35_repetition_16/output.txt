 The paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a field within computer science that develops machine intelligence for various applications like web search, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools. AI's long-term goal is general intelligence. Research methods include optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and statistical techniques. The field has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment (AI winter), but recent advancements in deep learning and transformer architecture have led to significant growth in funding and investment, often referred to as the AI boom. However, this rapid development has also raised concerns about unintended consequences, risks, and long-term effects, necessitating discussions on regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits for society.
