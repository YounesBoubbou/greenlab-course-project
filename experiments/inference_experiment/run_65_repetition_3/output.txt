The paper underscores artificial intelligence (AI) as machines' capacity for environmental perception and task execution based on learning to achieve goals, with applications ranging from autonomous vehicles like Waymo to creative tools such as ChatGPT. Though AI subfields focus on specific objectives using various techniques including mathematical optimization and neural networks drawing upon diverse disciplines, the quest toward general intelligence remains a long-term goal amid fluctuating interest and funding in its history since 1956â€”revealing cycles of 'AI winters' followed by investment surges post deep learning advancements. Recent AI ubiquity has unearthed negative repercussions, sparking debates on regulation for safety assurance and mitigating future risks as the technology burgeons to a trillion-dollar industry with widespread societal integration by 2030.
