Climate change is primarily driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from human activities that release carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere, thus trapping heat. These gases contribute to global warming with CO2 being most prevalent due to its significant production through fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation, transportation, industrial processes, deforestation, and various other energy-related activities.

The power sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases globally—especially in countries relying heavily on coal for electricity (e.g., China) or where non-renewable resources dominate the mix due to lack of investment in renewables (e.g., India). Here, CO2 emissions are a direct result from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal within power plants without sufficient carbon capture mechanisms.

Transportation is another significant contributor with an overwhelming share coming from the combustion of petroleum products in vehicles—cars, buses, trucks, airplanes which release CO2 as well as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds that can indirectly lead to increased methane levels.

Agriculture is responsible for a substantial portion of both CH4 emissions through enteric fermentation in ruminants, rice cultivation practices releasing biogenic methane as well as nitrous oxide from the use of synthetic fertilizers and manure management—the latter being potent contributors to N2O.

Industries like cement manufacturing release CO2 during production processes while industrial activities such as chemicals, steel, and aluminum also contribute significantly by burning fossil fuels for energy needs or releasing methane from natural gas pipelines that have minor leaks due to aging infrastructure.

Deforestation exacerbates GHG emissions—primarily CO2 release through the destruction of carbon-storing trees and peatlands while land use changes, like cattle ranching in previously forested areas or cultivating bioenergy crops on fertile lands can lead to further CH4 releases.

Each industry's contribution varies based on economic development levels; high income nations tend to have higher per capita emissions due mainly to industrial processes and personal transportation habits, while developing countries see a growing share of GHG output from energy-intensive industries expanding rapidly in sectors like power production.

Mitigating these emissions requires robust policies across various areas—enhancing renewable energies adoption, transitioning to electric vehicles and public transport systems with low carbon footprints for both passenger and freight services; improving energy efficiency throughout manufacturing processes including adopting cleaner technologies like hydrogen fuel cells in industries where electrification is challenging. Agriculture mitigation includes improved farming practices—like precision fertilization, manure management systems (anaerobic digesters), plant-based diets reducing methane from livest0ocks and rice paddies or adopting sustainable land use strategies to reduce deforestation. These measures across the sectors must align with economic development goals while being inclusive of low income countries' needs for growth without compromising environmental integrity—a balanced, just transition is critical in global climate action towards net-zero emissions and keeping within safe temperature rise limits as set by international agreements like Paris Agreement.
