Renewable energies are key for climate action; solar and wind growth is notable due to tech progress and cost drops. Their intermittency challenges the energy sector requiring advanced storage solutions and grid strategies. Policymakers have incentivized adoption via tax credits, feed-in tariffs, with further carbon neutrality achievable through comprehensive methods including efficiency improvements, sustainable infrastructure development, and global cooperation efforts.
