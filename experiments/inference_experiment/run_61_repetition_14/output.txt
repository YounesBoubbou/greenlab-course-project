The Industrial Revolution undeniably marked an era of rapid industrial growth with significant impact on economies, societies, and environments globally. Among its enduring consequences is a noticeable increase in greenhouse gas emissions leading to global warming—an issue that has since prompted international cooperation through agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and Paris Agreement (2016). These efforts aimed at reducing carbon footprints have led humanity down various paths of economic adaptation, often driven by technological innovation.

In response to climate change concerns, economies worldwide started investing in renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power as alternatives to fossil fuels—a primary source for greenhouse gases during the Industrial Revolution era. The cost of implementing these alternative energies has decreased over time due to technological advancements such as better photovoltaic cells, efficient turbines, advanced battery storage and smart grids - all part of a broader shift towards decarbonization economies often referred to in discussions around the 'Green Economy'.

Furthermore, climate-smart agricultural practices have emerged as ways for societies to adapt their food production systems. Techniques like precision farming and aquaponics aim at reducing environmental impacts while maintaining productivity—an approach often termed ‘Sustainable Agriculture’ or 'Climate Smart Farming'. Additionally, sustainable forestry practices have been developed to protect existing forests which act as carbon sinks.

On the technological frontier, advancements in fields like artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics are playing a vital role in climate change mitigation efforts by enabling accurate prediction models of future climatic scenarios—a field known as ‘Climate Science’ or more specifically 'Climate Modeling'. Additionally, the development of carbon capture technologies aimed at reducing emissions from industrial processes has been increasingly adopted.

Furthermore, eco-friendly transportation options such as electric vehicles (EVs), hydrogen fuel cell cars and even biofuels are gaining traction in response to climate change—a sector often referred to as 'Electromobility'. Last but not least is the rise of green buildings that prioritize energy efficiency, incorporating renewable materials into construction or harness solar power for operation.

To summarize, humanity's battle against Climate Change has led to significant advancements in various sectors and economic models—from a Green Economy focusing on sustainability practices across industries; the rise of Eco-Tourism emphasizing low impact travel experiences that preserve local ecosystems.

All these responses are interwoven into policies such as carbon pricing, which incentivizes emission reductions and facilitates investments towards cleaner technologies or 'Clean Energy Transition'. In essence, the response to climate change has spurred a new era of sustainable economic models where environmentally conscious practices become integral parts—a transformative journey that continues even beyond the Industrial Revolution's industrial legacy.
