Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses machine intelligence for perception, learning, planning, and natural language processing. Key applications include search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools like ChatGPT. AI research aims to achieve general intelligence through techniques such as neural networks, formal logic, and statistical methods. Founded in 1956, the field experienced multiple cycles of growth and funding cuts, but saw a significant boom after 2012 due to deep learning advancements and the transformer architecture by 2020. Today, AI raises concerns about unintended consequences and risks, prompting regulatory discussions for safe deployment.
