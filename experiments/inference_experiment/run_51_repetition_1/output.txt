The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), significantly vary across different sectors. In the energy sector, fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation, transportation, and heating remains a dominant source of CO₂ emissions. The oil and gas industry not only contributes to direct emissions through extraction processes but also from leaks in the production and distribution systems.

Agriculture is another significant contributor, primarily emitting methane (CH₄) from enteric fermentation in livestock and N₂O from fertilizers used in crop cultivation. Deforestation and land use changes further exacerbate these emissions by reducing the Earth's capacity to absorb CO₂ and releasing stored carbon.

Industrial activities contribute to greenhouse gas emissions through processes such as cement production, which releases significant amounts of CO₂, and waste management, where decomposition produces methane. The manufacturing sector also emits N₂O from various industrial processes involving nitric acid or amine solutions.

In the built environment, buildings' operational energy use, particularly for heating and cooling, contributes to CO₂ emissions. Construction practices and material production can release additional greenhouse gases during their lifecycle.

Transportation is a major source of CO₂ and CH₄ emissions, with road transport being the largest contributor due to high volumes of personal vehicle usage. Aviation, shipping, and rail also contribute substantially but on a smaller scale compared to road transport.

Understanding these variations across sectors helps in developing targeted strategies for emission reduction and highlights the importance of integrating climate policies across multiple industries.
