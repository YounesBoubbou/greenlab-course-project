The technical paper underscores AI's evolution from a concept rooted in imitating human cognition towards an integral part of everyday applications, as seen with search engines, recommendation systems and virtual assistants like Siri. Despite early hype cycles often leading to "winters" due to unmet expectations or ethical dilemmas, significant advancements have been made since 2017 through deep learning techniques such as transformers that propelled AI into a modern investment boom by the early 2020s. While its pervasive adoption has highlighted some negative impacts and safety concerns necessitating regulatory discussions, it's also clear that AI continues to be at the forefront of groundbreaking tools shaping various sectors including robotics with goals like achieving general intelligence remaining ambitious yet influential milestones. The paper encapsulates this complex journey and interdisciplinary nature in which diverse fields contribute knowledge, revealing both AI's potential to emulate human tasks at a level or above and its implications for the future of technology governance.
