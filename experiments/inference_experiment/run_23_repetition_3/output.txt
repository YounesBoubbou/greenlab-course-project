The provided technical paper defines artificial intelligence (AI) as machines that exhibit intelligence similar to humans. It is a field of research in computer science that uses techniques such as search, mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and statistics to enable machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions towards achieving goals. AI has numerous applications, including web search engines, recommendation systems, human speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and strategy games. General intelligence, or the ability to complete any task on an equal level to humans, is a long-term goal of AI research. The field has experienced multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winter, but funding and interest have increased since 2012 with the success of deep learning techniques and the transformer architecture. However, the widespread use of AI in recent years has exposed unintended consequences and harms, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
