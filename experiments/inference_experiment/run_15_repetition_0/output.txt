The primary sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions include fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, land-use changes, and agriculture. The most significant contributors to GHG emissions are:

1. **Fossil Fuel Combustion:** Power generation, transportation, and industrial processes account for approximately 65% of global CO2 emissions. This includes coal-fired power plants, vehicle exhausts, and industrial processes.
2. **Agriculture:** Livestock farming and rice cultivation release large amounts of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), respectively. Agriculture is responsible for around 10-12% of global GHG emissions.
3. **Industrial Processes:** Cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical processes release significant amounts of CO2, N2O, and CH4.
4. **Land-use Changes:** Deforestation, land degradation, and urbanization lead to the release of stored carbon into the atmosphere.

Variations across industries include:

* **Energy sector:** 55% of global GHG emissions are attributed to electricity generation and heat production.
* **Transportation:** On-road vehicles account for around 17% of global GHG emissions, while aviation and shipping contribute an additional 3%.
* **Agriculture:** Beef and lamb farming have higher methane emissions than other livestock, while rice cultivation is a significant source of N2O emissions.
* **Industrial processes:** Cement production releases large amounts of CO2 due to the calcination process.

Understanding these primary sources and their variations across industries is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate climate change.
