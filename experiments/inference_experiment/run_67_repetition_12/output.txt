The Industrial Revolution indeed marked an era of unprecedented growth but also led to significant environmental consequences, including a surge in greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent global warming. In acknowledgment of these challenges, international cooperation has materialized through agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) which legally bound industrial nations to emission reduction targets; however, its effectiveness was limited due to non-participation by major emitters like China and India at that time. This led up to the Paris Agreement in 2015 underlining a more inclusive framework with countries setting their own nationally determined contributions (NDCs) towards mitigating climate change, aiming for substantial reductions as per scientific recommendations by bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

In response to these agreements and growing awareness of sustainability's economic imperatives, technological advancements have been pivotal. Renewable energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels due to improvements in efficiency (e.g., the average capacity factor for utility-scale photovoltaic systems has improved from 15% in the late '70s, according to LBNL's National Renewable Energy Laboratory). Battery storage technology is advancing rapidly as well—with developments like lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries that are cheaper and more stable than previous versions; this allows for better integration of intermittent renewable sources into the grid.

In addition, green technologies have led to economic opportunities such as job creation in new industries—as reported by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), solar PV manufacturing alone employed over 3.8 million people globally at its peak production rate of around $150 billion per year from a renewable energy sector that was worth only tens of millions annually in the late '70s. Innovations like carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are also developing, potentially offsetting emissions by capturing them directly at their source—such as power plants or industrial facilities before they reach the atmosphere; though commercially viable deployment is still a challenge due to high costs according to estimates from EPRI.

Furthermore, circular economy principles have gained traction in response with industries shifting towards designing products for longevity and recyclability—a stark contrast compared to past practices of the throw-away culture that accelerated waste generation during industrialization (as discussed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation).

Governments are also implementing policies like feed-in tariffs, carbon pricing mechanisms such as cap-and-trade systems or taxes on emissions. For example, Sweden has a CO2 price of about $130 per ton which helps incentivize companies to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint—evidence that policy and market forces can align effectively when there is sufficient political will (as reflected by the EU Emission Trading System).

Lastly, finance for climate action has seen an uptick with instruments such as Green Bonds growing in popularity. According to Climate Bond Initiative data, green bond issuances reached $1 trillion cumulatively since 2007 by the end of November 2020—this underlines both investors' confidence and governments’ commitment towards environmental sustainability as they channel capital into low-carbon projects.

Collectively, these economic developments alongside technological innovations are integral components in formulating a multifaceted response to climate change post the Industrial Revolution—aiming not just for mitigation but also adaptation and resilience against its adverse impacts while promoting sustainable growth.
