The technical paper outlines the evolution and current state of artificial intelligence (AI), defining it as machines exhibiting intelligence through learning, perception, and goal achievement. Key applications include search engines, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools. AI research aims at goals like reasoning, planning, and natural language processing using techniques such as neural networks and formal logic. The field has experienced funding cycles with "AI winters," but saw a resurgence in 2012 with deep learning and gained unprecedented growth by the early 2020s due to transformer architecture advancements. Current concerns include unintended consequences, ethical risks, and long-term impacts, driving regulatory discussions for safer AI development.
