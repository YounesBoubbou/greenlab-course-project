Climate change is a complex phenomenon driven primarily by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The most significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) is fossil fuel combustion, particularly in the energy sector (coal, oil, and natural gas).

Methane (CH4), another potent GHG, is emitted from various sources such as agriculture (livestock manure and rice paddies)), landfills, and natural processes like wetlands.

Industrial activities, especially within the manufacturing, construction, and transportation sectors, also contribute significantly to emissions. For example, cement production releases large amounts of CO2, while vehicle exhausts include nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to air pollution.

In conclusion, climate change is driven by greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, landfills, and industrial activities. Addressing these sources and transitioning to cleaner energy systems is crucial for mitigating the impacts of climate change.
