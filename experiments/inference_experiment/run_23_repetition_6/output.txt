Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field that enables machines to exhibit intelligence through learning and taking actions to achieve defined goals. AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, generative art, and superhuman play in strategy games. However, many of these cutting-edge AI technologies are not labeled as AI. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. General intelligence is also a long-term goal. To reach these objectives, researchers have adapted and integrated techniques such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, among others. AI was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field has gone through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by disappointment and loss of funding known as AI winter. Funding and interest have increased significantly after 2012 with the development of deep learning and the transformer architecture. The widespread use of AI in the 21st century has exposed unintended consequences and harms, raising concerns about its risks and long-term effects. As a result, discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology have arisen.
