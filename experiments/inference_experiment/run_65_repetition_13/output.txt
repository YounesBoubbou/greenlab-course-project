This paper delves into artificial intelligence (AI), a domain where machines mimic human cognition through learning from environmental interactions for goal achievement, touching on its integration across various industries—from search engines to autonomous vehicles. Traditional AI research areas like reasoning and natural language processing have evolved with advancements in subfields such as deep learning and neural networks after significant funding revival since 2012 due to transformer architecture breakthroughs, leading to an "AI boom." Despite the profound benefits of pervasive AI use by mid-century, it has also resulted in unintended consequences that have fueled debates on regulation for safe and beneficial utilization. The paper underscores a historical cyclical pattern with periods of optimism followed by "winters" due to funding losses but notes the resurgence post deep learning's success, reflecting AI’s dynamic trajectory influenced by cutting-edge tools that shape its development and societal integration.
