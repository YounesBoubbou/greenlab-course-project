Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to develop methods and software enabling machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. AI has many high-profile applications such as advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, human speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, generative and creative tools, and strategic games like chess and Go. However, these applications are often not perceived as AI because once they become useful enough and common enough, they lose their "AI" label. The various subfields of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence, which involves the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level, is one of the long-term goals of AI. To achieve these goals, researchers have adapted and integrated techniques from mathematics, operations research, statistics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.

AI has undergone multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winters, with funding and interest fluctuating over time. However, the field's growth accelerated in the early 2010s after deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms, leading to discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
