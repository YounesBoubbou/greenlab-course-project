 Renewable energy sources are essential for combating climate change. Solar and wind power have grown due to technological advancements. However, their intermittency requires the development of energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers can accelerate the transition by offering incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs. Achieving carbon neutrality demands a holistic approach involving energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and international collaboration.
