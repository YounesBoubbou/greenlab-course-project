 AI is a computer science field focused on creating systems that can perceive their environment, learn, and act autonomously. Applications range from search engines to autonomous vehicles. The traditional goals include reasoning, perception, learning, and natural language processing, among others. The long-term aim is general intelligence. Techniques used in AI are diverse, including search algorithms, formal logic, neural networks, and methods from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc. AI has experienced periods of optimism followed by setbacks known as "AI winter," but funding and interest have significantly increased since 2012 due to advancements in deep learning and transformer architectures. This growth led to investments of hundreds of billions of dollars in the early 2020s (AI boom). However, widespread use has highlighted unintended consequences and future risks, sparking discussions about regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
