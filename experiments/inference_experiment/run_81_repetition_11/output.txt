Greenhouse gas emissions arise from a multitude of sources across various industries.

**Carbon Dioxide (CO2):** The largest contributor stems from **electricity and heat production**, primarily reliant on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. **Transportation**, fueled by gasoline and diesel, is another significant source. **Industry**, including manufacturing, cement production, and steelmaking, emits substantial CO2 through energy consumption and chemical processes.

**Methane (CH4):**  Agriculture, particularly livestock rearing and rice cultivation, is responsible for a large portion of methane emissions due to digestive processes and flooded fields. **Natural gas extraction and distribution** leak significant amounts during production and transport. 

**Nitrous Oxide (N2O):** Agricultural activities like fertilizer use and manure management are major sources of N2O. **Industrial processes**, including nitric acid production, also contribute. 

These emissions vary across industries:

* **Electricity & Heat:** Dominated by CO2 from fossil fuel combustion.
* **Transportation:**  Primarily reliant on gasoline and diesel for CO2 emissions.
* **Agriculture:** Significant CH4 and N2O contributions from livestock and fertilizer use.
* **Industry:** Diverse emissions profile depending on processes, including CO2, CH4, and N2O.

Addressing climate change necessitates reducing these emissions through cleaner energy sources, sustainable transportation, efficient industrial practices, and responsible agricultural methods.
