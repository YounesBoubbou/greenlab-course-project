The technical paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI), highlighting its applications, subfields, and historical development. AI is defined as intelligence exhibited by machines, enabling them to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals. Traditional AI research goals include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The paper notes that many AI applications are not perceived as AI due to their commonality and usefulness. The development of deep learning and the transformer architecture led to increased funding and interest in AI, resulting in the AI boom. However, the widespread use of AI has exposed unintended consequences and harms, raising concerns about its risks and long-term effects. As a result, discussions are underway regarding regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of AI technology.
