 Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere. Among these gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most significant contributor, accounting for about 76% of total global GHG emissions. Fossil fuel combustion is the largest source of CO2 emissions, which includes the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation, industry processes, and transportation.
Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are other potent greenhouse gases that contribute substantially to climate change. Methane is about 28 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO2 over a 100-year time frame. The primary sources of methane emissions include agriculture (livestock and manure management, rice cultivation, and manure management), landfills, and natural gas and oil systems.
Nitrous oxide is about 300 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2 over a 100-year time frame. The major sources of nitrous oxide emissions are agriculture (especially the use of nitrogen fertilizers), industrial processes, and biomass burning.
The energy sector, led by fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation, is responsible for the largest share of global GHG emissions. In 2019, it accounted for around 37% of the total emissions. The industry sector, which includes manufacturing, construction, and mining, contributed about 23%. Agriculture, forestry, and other land use activities accounted for about 24% of global GHG emissions in 2019. Transportation was responsible for approximately 15% of the total emissions.
In summary, carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion is the largest contributor to climate change, while methane and nitrous oxide also play substantial roles. The primary sources of these emissions vary across industries, with the energy sector being the largest contributor to global GHG emissions, followed by industry, agriculture, and transportation.
