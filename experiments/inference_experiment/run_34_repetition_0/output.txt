 Renewable energy growth (solar, wind) is central to climate change mitigation due to technological advancements and cost reductions. However, intermittency issues demand energy storage tech & grid integration. Policymakers use incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a holistic approach encompassing energy efficiency, infrastructure development, and international cooperation.
