Artificial intelligence (AI) involves developing computer systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Key applications include search engines, recommendation systems, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools. AI encompasses various subfields like reasoning, learning, perception, and robotics. It has historically faced periods of optimism and disappointment but saw significant growth after 2012 due to deep learning advancements, particularly the transformer architecture by 2020. Today, AI's rapid development raises concerns about unintended consequences and long-term risks, prompting calls for regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
