Climate change is primarily caused by an increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs), notably carbon dioxide (CO₂) resulting from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These activities release vast amounts of CO₂ into the atmosphere each year because they were historically used for energy production in various sectors including electricity generation, transportation, manufacturing, heating buildings, etc., making them major sources of emissions that drive climate change.

Methane (CH₄), another potent GHG with a much higher warming potential than CO₂ over short periods, is predominantly released through agricultural practices such as rice cultivation and the raising of ruminant animals like cows for meat production – particularly from enteric fermentation in these livestock. It also emanates during incomplete combustion processes within industrial settings including wastewater treatment facilities where organic matter breaks down anaerobically, releasing methane as a byproduct.

Nitrous oxide (N₂O), though present at much lower concentrations than CO₂ and CH₄ in the atmosphere but with significant warming potential over longer periods, primarily emanates from agricultural soils after applying synthetic fertilizers high in nitrogen content – such as those containing ammonia or urea.

Industries vary significantly when it comes to their contributions to GHGs: 
- The energy sector is the largest source of CO₂ emissions, due largely to its reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation and heating purposes. Transitioning towards renewable sources can mitigate these outputs substantially by decreasing dependency on carbonaceous fuel combustion processes that release vast amounts into our atmosphere daily.
- In transportation – which is responsible for a considerable share of global emissions, particularly CO₂ - burning petroleum products in cars and airplanes are primary sources; thus initiatives such as electric vehicles' adoption or more efficient engines could reduce the sector’s carbon footprint significantly by decreasing fuel use.
- Manufacturing industries contribute substantially to both CH₄ (methane) via leaks during extraction, transportation and production processes of natural gas; while in CO₂ emissions through energy consumption associated with manufacturing activities - these sectors can reduce their impacts significantly by adopting cleaner technologies or alternative sources.
- Agriculture is a significant source for both CH₄ (enteric fermentation) from livestock, and N₂O as soil fertilizers break down – thus practices like precision farming that optimize input use could help curb such emissions substantially while maintaining agricultural productivity levels; integrated systems which combine crops with animal husbandry may also have potential.
- The waste sector releases methane during the decomposition of organic materials in landfill sites and from anaerobic digesters treating sewage sludge - capturing this gas for use as renewable energy could transform these sources into a valuable resource rather than letting them contribute to climate change.
  
In conclusion, different industries have varying contributions toward GHG emissions due in part to their reliance on fossil fuels and the nature of specific activities occurring within each sector – but all hold potential for reducing mitigation through transition towards clean energy sources or adoptive practices promoting resource efficiency. Addressing these varied emission profiles is critical as we seek substantial climate change solutions, with industry often being a significant contributor to our current predicament due its reliance on carbon-based fuels and associated processes – but also stands at the center of opportunities for transformative changes that could lead us toward environmental sustainability.
