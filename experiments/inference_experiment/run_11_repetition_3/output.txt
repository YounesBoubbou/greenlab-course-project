The provided technical paper discusses artificial intelligence (AI) as a field of research in computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. AI has various subfields, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. The long-term goal is to develop general intelligence, allowing machines to complete tasks on an equal level with humans. To reach this goal, researchers have adapted techniques from search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and statistics. AI draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. The field has gone through cycles of optimism and disappointment, but funding increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous techniques. Today, hundreds of billions of dollars are invested in AI, exposing unintended consequences and raising concerns about its risks and long-term effects, prompting discussions on regulatory policies to ensure the technology's safety and benefits.
