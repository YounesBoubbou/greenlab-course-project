 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that develops methods for machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve goals. Applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and strategy games. AI research aims for general intelligence, using techniques like search, logic, neural networks, and statistics. Founded in 1956, AI has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment, with recent growth due to deep learning and transformer architecture. Concerns over unintended consequences and risks have led to discussions on regulatory policies for safe and beneficial use of AI. Key subfields include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics support. AI draws upon various fields including psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and more.
