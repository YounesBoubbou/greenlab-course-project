 Renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind power, are key to combatting climate change due to technological advancements and decreasing costs. Intermittency challenges require energy storage tech and grid integration. Policymakers use incentives to accelerate transition, but a holistic approach including energy efficiency, infrastructure development, and international collaboration is necessary for carbon neutrality.
