 AI is a computer science field that develops systems to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence, such as speech recognition, decision-making, learning, and perception. Applications range from web search engines to autonomous vehicles. AI subfields include reasoning, natural language processing, and perception, with the ultimate goal of general intelligence. Techniques used include optimization, formal logic, neural networks, and statistics. Despite fluctuations in funding due to perceived limitations (AI winter), interest has surged since 2012, driven by advancements like deep learning and transformer architecture. However, widespread use has raised concerns about unintended consequences and potential risks for the future, necessitating discussions on regulatory policies.
