 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that enables machines to learn from data and perform tasks, such as speech recognition, image recognition, and decision-making, with human-like intelligence. AI has various applications including search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and strategy games. AI research focuses on goals like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, robotics, and general intelligence. Techniques used include optimization, formal logic, neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. AI was founded in 1956 but faced cycles of optimism and disappointment until recent advances like deep learning and transformer architecture led to significant investment and growth. However, the widespread use of AI has exposed concerns about unintended consequences and potential risks, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
