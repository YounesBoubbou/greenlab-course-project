1. Austria - Vienna
2. Belgium - Brussels
3. Bulgaria - Sofia
4. Croatia - Zagreb
5. Cyprus - Nicosia
6. Czech Republic - Prague
7. Denmark - Copenhagen
8. Estonia - Tallinn

14. Iceland - Reykjavik
15. Ireland - Dublin
16. Italy - Rome
17. Latvia - Riga
18. Lithuania - Vilnius

For countries outside the EU that are geographically part of Europe, such as Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland (not in the EU), their respective capital cities can be found using similar resources to those listed above.

In summary, the capital cities of all European Union member states, plus some additional European countries, are provided. This list is accurate as of my knowledge update in 2021.
