The Industrial Revolution marked an era of unprecedented growth but also brought forth significant environmental challenges, including a notable rise in greenhouse gas emissions which are largely responsible for global warming and its associated effects such as extreme weather conditions. Recognizing this threat has led to international efforts like the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and later the Paris Agreement (2015), aimed at mitigating climate change by reducing emissions levels globally through legally binding commitments, although their effectiveness remains a topic of debate.

In response to these environmental concerns has arisen an array of economic incentives designed both for countries and corporations to reduce carbon footprints; such as the implementation of carbon pricing mechanisms like emissions trading systems (ETS) which provide financial motivation for reducing pollution, effectively internalizing what was once a negative externality. Furthermore, these market-based approaches have been complemented by government subsidies promoting clean energy production and consumption, thus facilitating the transition to renewable resources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power—the growth of which has witnessed exponential rates in recent years, driven both by technological innovation and decreasing costs.

In terms of technology itself, there have been groundbreaking advances with implications for climate action including the development of electric vehicles (EVs), energy-efficient appliances, smart grids to optimize power distribution based on real-time demand, and carbon capture technologies that extract CO2 directly from industrial processes before it reaches the atmosphere. Moreover, digitization through artificial intelligence has become an essential tool in monitoring environmental changes; allowing for more accurate predictions of weather patterns which enable better preparation against natural disasters exacerbated by climate change.

Energy storage technologies such as advanced battery systems have been pivotal too, overcoming one major hurdle to renewable energy integration – its intermittency; while the advancement in material science is contributing directly towards reducing emissions through improvements like low-carbon cement and concrete alternatives. The rise of vertical farming techniques has also promised both a reduction in agriculture's carbon footprint as well as resilience against climate change impact on traditional crops, representing an innovative approach to food security under changing environmental conditions.

The economic aspect sees sectors like green finance burgeoning; investment funds and policies are aimed at channeling capital into sustainable projects which offer both ecological benefits as well as competitive returns for stakeholders, thus transforming the perception of ‘green’ being financially suboptimal. Initiatives such as green bonds have emerged to fund climate-related investments while corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs increasingly include stringent environmental targets alongside business growth objectives – a testament to an evolving understanding that economic progress and ecological stewardship are not mutually exclusive.

Collectively, these advancements underscore the significant strides made in technology and economics as part of humanity's response to climate change following industrialization-induced environmental degradation; showcasing a robust commitment from international entities alongside national governments, industries, academia, nonprofits, social movements, and consumers alike towards forging an equitable path forward. The journey is far from complete but the trajectory appears promising as these initiatives gain momentum in response to urgent global warming challenges we face today, pointing toward a more sustainable future while also acknowledging past mistakes that have led us herein this moment of reckoning with our planet's changing climate.
