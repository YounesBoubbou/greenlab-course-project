 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that develops methods for machines to perceive their environment and take actions based on learning and intelligence. Applications include web search, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools. AI research aims for general intelligence but includes subfields like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. Techniques range from optimization and logic to neural networks and statistics. AI was founded in 1956, experiencing cycles of optimism and disappointment, with renewed interest since the 2010s due to deep learning and transformer architecture. Concerns about unintended consequences and future risks have led to discussions on regulatory policies.
