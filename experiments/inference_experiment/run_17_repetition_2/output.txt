The technical paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research that aims to develop machines that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve defined goals. The paper highlights various subfields of AI, including reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. It also discusses the long-term goal of achieving general intelligence, where machines can complete tasks on an at least equal level as humans. To reach this goal, researchers have adapted and integrated techniques from various fields, including search, mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, statistics, operations research, economics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The paper notes that AI has undergone cycles of optimism and disappointment since its founding in 1956, but recent advancements in deep learning have led to significant growth and investment in the field, raising concerns about unintended consequences and regulatory policies for safety and benefits.
