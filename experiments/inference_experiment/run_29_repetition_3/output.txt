 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that enables machines to perceive their environment, learn, and take actions to achieve goals. Applications include search engines, recommendation systems, speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, creative tools, and strategy games. AI research focuses on traditional goals like reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, robotics, and general intelligence. Techniques used include search, logic, neural networks, and statistics. Founded in 1956, AI experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment until recent growth driven by deep learning and the transformer architecture. Widespread use has raised concerns about unintended consequences and future risks, leading to discussions on regulatory policies.
