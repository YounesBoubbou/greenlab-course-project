The technical paper provides a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI), defining it as machine intelligence that allows computers to perceive environments, learn, and take actions towards goal achievement. Key applications range from search engines and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and generative tools like ChatGPT. AI research subfields include reasoning, learning, natural language processing, and robotics. The field has experienced multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment due to funding fluctuations (AI winter). Recent advancements, particularly deep learning and the transformer architecture post-2017, have spurred significant investment and growth in AI. However, widespread use has raised concerns about unintended consequences, harms, and long-term risks, leading to calls for regulatory policies to ensure safety and benefits.
