The adoption of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, has significantly grown due to technological improvements and falling costs. However, their intermittent nature requires development of storage technologies and grid integration strategies. Policymakers have implemented incentives to promote the transition towards carbon neutrality, which requires a holistic approach including energy efficiency and international collaboration.
