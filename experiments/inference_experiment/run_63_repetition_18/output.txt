Climate change is primarily driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation due to human activities such as fossil fuel combustion. Carbon dioxide emissions result chiefly from burning coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity, heat, transportation, industrial processes, and deforestation without adequate reforestation practices since trees absorb CO2 when they grow.

Methane (CH4), a GHG with over 80 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide per unit mass but which has a shorter atmospheric lifetime, emanates predominantly from agricultural sources such as livestock and rice paddies due to enteric fermentation in animals. It also arises substantially through incomplete organic waste decomposition occurring at landfills and during the fossil fuel extraction process like coal mining and oil drilling, where methane is often released from underground reserves ('fugitive emissions').

Nitrous oxide (N2O), another potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change with a global warming potential approximately 300 times that of carbon dioxide per unit mass, mostly originates from agricultural soil management practices involving the use and overuse of synthetic fertilizers rich in nitrogen. It also stems from industrial activities like chemical production and fossil fuel combustion with incomplete or improperly managed refrigeration cycles that result in chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) releases, which indirectly lead to N2O emissions after their breakdown into nitrous oxide.

In the energy sector, coal-fired power plants are a significant source of CO2 but also contribute small amounts of methane and NOx during fuel extraction and transportation; natural gas processing can produce CH4 as well while using techniques like flaring or venting to dispose off excess gases. The industrial process emissions sector, which includes the production of chemicals such as cement, steel (which involves calcination reactions), iron ore smelting, refining petroleum and natural gas liquids, all emit CO2 but may also release methane during extraction operations like oil field completions.

In transportation industries across land, sea, air, the primary source of GHG emissions is carbon dioxide from internal combustion engines running on petroleum-based fuels (gasoline and diesel). Some electric vehicles may also contribute to methane if using natural gas as a fuel or battery production processes. The maritime industry contributes substantially via bunker oil, which ships burn for energy with large emissions of CO2; however, the risk of methane leakage is notable due to its propensity in liquid form at low temperatures and high pressures that can occur during fuel transfer or use on board vessels.

In these ways across various industries—electric power generation being by far the largest contributor for all three GHGs, followed closely behind with transportation emissions playing a significant role especially in CO2 but not as prominent methane and nitrous oxide sources directly within this sector—the primary origins of greenhouse gas contributions to climate change vary.
