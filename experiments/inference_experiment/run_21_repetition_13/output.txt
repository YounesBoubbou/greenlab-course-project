The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions are the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes. These activities release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing significantly to climate change. In addition, methane and nitrous oxide are also released during these processes, but in smaller quantities than carbon dioxide.
Methane emissions are primarily associated with the agriculture industry, particularly from livestock and rice cultivation. It is also produced during natural gas extraction and transportation. Nitrous oxide emissions are mainly generated from the use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture and industrial processes such as wastewater treatment and sewage sludge management.
The energy sector is another major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the burning of coal and oil for electricity generation. The transportation industry also contributes significantly, with the emission of carbon dioxide primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles.
Overall, the sources and variations of greenhouse gas emissions across different industries highlight the need for targeted interventions to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.
