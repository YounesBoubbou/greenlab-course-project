Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide being the most significant contributor due to fossil fuel combustion. The primary sources of these emissions can be categorized into various industries.

The energy sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for approximately 65% of total emissions. Within this sector, fossil fuel-based power plants and industrial processes are major contributors. For example, coal-fired power plants emit significant amounts of CO2, while oil refineries and natural gas production also release substantial amounts of methane.

The transportation sector is another significant source of emissions, with road vehicles being the largest contributor. Passenger cars and light-duty trucks account for around 60% of total transport-related emissions, while heavy-duty trucks, buses, and aircraft contribute smaller but still notable shares.

Industrial processes, such as cement production, steel manufacturing, and chemical processing, also release substantial amounts of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide. The agricultural sector, particularly livestock farming and rice cultivation, is a significant source of nitrous oxide emissions.

Other industries, like construction, mining, and waste management, also emit greenhouse gases, although to a lesser extent. Understanding the primary sources of these emissions across different industries is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate climate change.
