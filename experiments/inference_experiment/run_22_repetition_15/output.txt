Renewable energy sources are crucial for combating climate change. Technological advancements and decreasing costs have led to growth in solar and wind power. Energy storage technologies and grid integration strategies are needed to address the intermittency challenge. Policymakers use incentives to speed up the transition, but a holistic approach that includes energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure development, and international collaboration is required for achieving carbon neutrality.
