Rules:
- Each country in Europe has a unique code that corresponds to its name in uppercase. 
- The codes are represented as alphanumeric strings with the first character being a letter and all other characters being numbers. For example, 'A12345' is the code for Albania (A1).
- The sum of all the codes represents the total capital cities' number in Europe.
- You need to find which European country's name has the highest coded value.

Question: Which country has the highest coded value?


First, we calculate the code for each country by summing up the values represented in the alphanumeric strings. 

Then, compare all codes and identify which one is the highest. If two or more countries have the same highest code, then they both are considered to be tied for first place.

Answer: The answer depends on the calculated numerical values of each country's name. You can find it by calculating these values and comparing them.
