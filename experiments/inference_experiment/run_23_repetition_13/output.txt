The technical paper provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, which aim to enable machines to perceive their environment, learn, and act in a way that maximizes their chances of achieving defined goals. AI has found numerous applications across different domains such as web search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools, among others. However, many AI applications are not perceived as such due to their widespread use and integration into general software systems. The field of AI research encompasses several techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics, drawing upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Despite the rapid growth and development in AI, unintended consequences and harms have emerged, raising concerns about its risks and future effects, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure its safety and benefits.
