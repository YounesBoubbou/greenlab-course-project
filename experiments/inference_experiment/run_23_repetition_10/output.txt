The technical paper provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI), defining it as intelligence exhibited by machines. AI is a broad field of research that develops methods and software for machines to perceive their environment, learn from it, and take actions to achieve defined goals. AI has numerous applications such as advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, human-speech interaction, autonomous vehicles, and generative tools. However, many AI applications are not labeled as such because they have become commonplace. The subfields of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics, with general intelligence being a long-term goal. To reach these goals, AI researchers use a variety of techniques such as search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. The field has experienced multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, but it experienced significant growth after 2012 with deep learning outperforming previous AI techniques. This led to the transformation of the industry and prompted discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.
