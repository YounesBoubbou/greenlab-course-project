The paper provides an overview of the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various subfields, goals, and techniques. AI is defined as intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems, which are capable of perceiving their environment and taking actions to maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. The paper highlights several high-profile applications of AI, such as web search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and creative tools. However, the author notes that many AI applications are not perceived as AI due to their widespread adoption and common usage. The paper also discusses the long-term goals of AI research, including general intelligence, and the various techniques used to achieve these goals, such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. Finally, the paper mentions the growth of AI funding and interest in recent years, leading to concerns about its risks and long-term effects.
